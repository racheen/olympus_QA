   MEDUSA &amp; GORGONS (Medousa &amp; Gorgones) - Snake-Haired Monsters of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology the Gorgons were three powerful, winged daemons named Medusa, Sthenno and Euryale. Of the three sisters only Medusa was mortal. King Polydectes of Seriphus once commanded the hero Perseus to fetch her head. He accomplished this with the help of the gods who equipped him with a reflective shield, a curved sword, winged boots and helm of invisibility. When he fell upon Medusa and decapitated her, two creatures sprang forth from the wound--the winged horse Pegasus and the giant Chrysaor. Perseus fled with the monster's head in a sack and her two angry sisters chasing close on his heels." name="description"/>

     THE GORGONES (Gorgons) were three powerful, winged
     <em>
      daimones
     </em>
     named Medousa (Medusa), Sthenno and Euryale. Of the three sisters only Medousa was mortal. King Polydektes of Seriphos once commanded the hero
     <a href="../Heros/Perseus.html">
      Perseus
     </a>
     to fetch her head. He accomplished this with the help of the gods who equipped him with a reflective shield, a curved sword, winged boots and helm of invisibility. When he fell upon Medousa and decapitated her, two creatures sprang forth from the wound--the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and the giant Khrysaor (Chrysaor). Perseus fled with the monster's head in a sack and  her two angry sisters chasing close on his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to late classical poets, Medousa was once a beautiful woman who was transformed into a monster by Athena as punishment for lying with Poseidon in her shrine. Earlier Greek writers and artists, however, simply portray her as a monster born into a large family of monsters.
    </p>
    <p>
     The three Gorgones were depicted in ancient Greek vase painting and sculpture as winged women with broad, round heads, serpentine locks of hair, large staring eyes, wide mouths, lolling tongues, the tusks of swine, flared nostrils, and sometimes short, coarse beards. 
  Medousa was humanised in late classical art with the face of a beautiful woman. In mosaic art her round face was wreathed with coiling snakes and adorned with a pair of small wings on the brow.

     GORGO and GO′RGONES (Gorgô and Gorgones). Homer knows only one Gorgo, who, according to the Odyssey (xi. 633), was one of the frightful phantoms in Hades: in the Iliad (v. 741, viii. 349, xi. 36; comp. Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     vi. 289), the Aegis of Athena contains the head of Gorgo, the terror of her enemies. Euripides (
     <em>
      Ion,
     </em>
     989) still speaks of only one Gorgo, although Hesiod (

      Theog.
     </em>
     278) had mentioned three Gorgones, the daughters of Phorcys and Ceto, whence they are sometimes called Phorcydes or Phorcides. (Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Prom.
     </em>
     793, 797; Pind.
     <em>
      Pyth.
     </em>
     xii. 24; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     v. 230.) The names of the three Gorgones are Stheino (Stheno or Stenusa), Euryale, and Medusa (Hes.
     <em>
      l. c.
     </em>
     ; Apollod. ii. 4. § 2), and they are conceived by Hesiod to live in the Western Ocean, in the neighbourhood of Night and the Hesperides. But later traditions place them in Libya. (Herod. ii. 91; Paus. ii. 21. § 6.) They are described (
     <em>
      Scut. Here.
     </em>
     233) as girded with serpents, raising their heads, vibrating their tongues, and gnashing their teeth; Aeschylus (
     <em>
      Prom.
     </em>
     794. &amp;c.,
     <em>
      Choëph.
     </em>
     1050) adds that they had wings and brazen claws, and enormous teeth. On the chest of Cypselus they were likewise represented with wings. (Paus. v. 18. § 1.) Medusa, who alone of her sisters was mortal, was, according to some legends, at first a beautiful maiden, but her hair was changed into serpents by Athena, in consequence of her having become by Poseidon the mother of Chrysaor and Pegasus, in one of Athena's temples. (Hes.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     287, &amp;c.; Apollod. ii. 4. § 3; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     iv. 792; comp. Perseus.) Her head was now of so fearful an appearance, that every one who looked at it was changed into stone. Hence the great difficulty which Perseus had in killing her; and Athena afterwards placed the head in the centre of her shield or breastplate. There was a tradition at Athens that the head of Medusa was buried under a mound in the Agora. (Paus. ii. 21. § 6, v. 12. § 2.) Athena gave to Heracles a lock of Medusa (concealed in an urn), for it had a similar effect upon the beholder as the head itself. When Heracles went out against Lacedaemon he gave the lock of hair to Sterope, the daughter of Cepheus, as a protection of the town of Tegea, as the sight of it would put the enemy to fight. (Paus. viii. 47. § 4; Apollod. ii. 7. § 3.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The mythus respecting the family of Phorcys, to which also the Graeae, Hesperides, Scylla, and other fabulous beings belonged, has been interpreted in various ways by the ancients themselves. Some believed that the Gorgones were formidable animals with long hair, whose aspect was so frightful, that men were paralysed or killed by it, and some of the soldiers of Marius were believed to have thus met with their death (Athen. v. 64). Pliny (
     <em>
      H. N.
     </em>
     iv. 31) thought that they were a race of savage, swift, and hair-covered women; and Diodorus (iii. 55) regards them as a race of women inhabiting the western parts of Libya, who had been extirpated by Heracles in traversing Libya.

     , which they say was a knapsack. Pindar and Hesiod in the

     <br/>
     Perseus took flight and made his way to Okeanos (Oceanus), where he found the Gorgones (Gorgons) sleeping. Their names were Stheno, Euryale and the third was Medousa (Medusa), the only mortal one: thus it was her head that Perseus was sent to bring back. The Gorgones' heads were entwined with the horny scales of serpents, and they had big tusks like hogs, bronze hands, and wings of gold on which they flew. All who looked at them were turned to stone. Perseus, therefore, with Athene guiding his hand, kept his eyes on the reflection in a bronze shield as he stood over the sleeping Gorgones, and when he saw the image of Medousa, he beheaded her. As soon as her head was severed there leaped from her body the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and Khrysaor (Chrysaor) the father of Geryon. The father of these two was Poseidon. Perseus then placed the head in the
     <em>
      kibisis
     </em>
     and headed back again, as the Gorgones pursued him through the air. But the helmet kept him hidden, and made it impossible for them to identify him . . .

     "[Pausanias presents a rationalisation of the Medousa myth :] In the market-place of Argos is a mound of earth, in which they say lies the head of the Gorgon Medousa (Medusa). I omit the miraculous, but give the rational parts of the story about her. After the death of her father, Phorkys (Phorcys), she reigned over those living around Lake Tritonis, going out hunting and leading the Libyans to battle. On one such occasion, when she was encamped with an army over against the forces of Perseus, who was followed by picked troops from the Peloponnesos, she was assassinated by night. Perseus, admiring her beauty even in death, cut off her head and carried it to show the Greeks. But Prokles (Procles), the son of Eukrates (Eucrates), a Carthaginian, thought a different account more plausible that the preceding. It is as follows. Among the incredible monsters to be found in the Libyan desert are wild men and wild women. Prokles affirmed that he had seen a man from them who had been brought to Rome. So he guessed that a woman from them, reached Lake Tritonis, and harried the neighbours until Perseus killed her; Athena was supposed to have helped him in this exploit, because the people who live around Lake Tritonis are sacred to her."

For when the godlike Perseus, whom his mother called Eurymedon, flew over Libye (Libya) brining the Gorgon's newly severed head to the king, every drop of dark blood that fell from it to the ground produced a brood of these serpents. Mopsos, stepping forward with his left foot, brought the sole down on the tip of the creature's tail, and in its pain the snake coiled round his shin and calf and bit him halfway up the leg tearing the flesh . . . The poor man was doomed. A paralysing numbness was already creeping through him, and a dark mist began to dim his sight.

The fresh sea-weed, with living spongy cells, absorbed the monster's power and at its touch hardened, its fronds and branches stiff and strange. The Sea-Nymphs (
     <em>
      Nymphae Pelagi
     </em>
     ) tried the magic on more weed and found to their delight it worked the same, and sowed the changeling seeds back on the waves. Coral still keeps that nature; in the air it hardens, what beneath the sea has grown a swaying plant, above it, turns to stone."

      Ovid, Metamorphoses 5. 178 ff :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[When Perseus was battling the Aithiopian (Ethiopian) Prince Phineus and his thousand men :] Perseus saw that valour could not vie with weight of numbers. ‘You, yourselves,’ he cried. ‘Compel me! I'll seek succour from my foe! If any friend is present, turn away your face!’ And he held up the Gorgon's head. ‘Find someone else to fear your miracles!’         said Thescelus, aiming his lance of doom, and in that pose he stayed, a marble statue. Next Ampyx lunged his sword at Lyncides' [Perseus'] heart, that great and valiant heart, and as he lunged his hand, rigid, moved neither back nor forth.
     <br/>
     But Nileus . . . cried ‘See the source of my proud lineage! You'll get great solace in the silent umbrae (shades of the dead) to know you fell by my proud hand.’ His voice was cut off in mid speech, his parted lips seemed to frame words, but never a word could pass.
     <br/>
     Then Eryx cursed them: ‘It's your cowardice that holds you frozen, not the Gorgon's power. Charge him with me, charge him, and bring him down, him and his magic weapon!’ As he charged the floor fastened his feet, and there he stayed stock still, a man in armour turned to stone.
     <br/>
     These paid the proper price, but there was one, a warrior on Perseus' side, Aconteus, who, fighting for his lord, looked at the head, Medusa's head, and hardened into stone. Astyages, who thought him still alive, hit him with his long-sword, and loud and shrill the long sword rang. And he, gazing aghast, took the same stoniness, caught there and fixed with blank amazement in his marble face.
     <br/>
     To name the rank and file who fought and died would take too long; two hundred still survived, two hundred saw that head and turned to stone. Now Phineus rues his battle so unjust--at last. But what is he to do? He sees statues in many poses, knows they are his men, calls each by name and begs his aid. In disbelief he touched those nearest him: marble they were! He turned away, his hands held abject in defeat, his arms outstretched sideways for mercy. ‘You have won,’ he said, ‘Put down your Medusa's head whoever she may be, that makes men marble! Put it down, I beg! . . .’
     <br/>
     He dared not look at Perseus as he spoke; and Perseus answered ‘Cowardest of cowards! What I have power to grant, I grant; and great the guerdon to your craven soul. Fear not! No steel shall work you woe. Oh, no! my gift shall be an everlasting monument. In Cepheus' palace men shall gaze at you for ever, and my wife take comfort from the sight of her betrothed.’
     <br/>
     And as he speaks he thrusts Phorcynis' [Medousa's (Medusa's)] head in Phineus' face, his wincing face. Even then he tries to turn his eyes away, but now his neck is stiff, his moist eyes fixed and hard and stony. There with frightened pleading face and abject hands, in cringing pose the marble statue stands.
     <br/>
     Abantiades [Perseus] returned in triumph with his wife to Argos, his ancestral city. There to champion and avenge his grandfather, Acrisius, despite his ill-deserts, he challenged Proetus. Proetus had usurped Argos' high stronghold and expelled his brother by force of arms. But neither force of arms nor stronghold, basely seized, availed against the ghastly snake-haired's glaring eyes. Yet Polydectes, lord of small Seriphus . . . belittled Perseus' praise and even claimed Medusa's death a lie. ‘I'll give you proof conclusive.’ Perseus cried, ‘Friends, shield your eyes!’ and with Medusa's face he changed the king's face to bloodless stone."

     COMMENTARY
    </h2>
    <p>
     The poet Hesiod seems to have envisaged the Gorgones (Gorgons) as reef-creating sea-daemones, personifications of the deadly submerged rocks which posed such a danger to ancient mariners. As such he names the three petrifyers daughters of dangerous sea-gods. One also bears a distincty marine name, Euryale, "she of the wide, briny sea". Later writers continue this tradition when they speak of reefs being created  where  Perseus had set the Gorgon's head and where he had turned a sea monster to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
     In other motifs, the Gorgon Medousa (Medusa) was a portrayed as a storm-daemon
  whose visage was set upon the storm-bringing aigis-shield  of Athene. The two ideas were probably connected, with sea storms driving ships to destruction upon the reefs.   Some say there was a but a single goat-like Gorgon (Gorgo), a daughter of the Sun-God, who was slain by Zeus at the start of the Titan-War to form his stormy aigis shield.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Gorgones were probably also connected with Demeter Erinys (the Fury) and the three Erinyes. These goddesses could bring drought, wither the crops and herald famine. In myth, the beheading of Medousa  saw the release of two beings--Pegasos (of the springs) and Khrysaor (golden blade). This story might have symbolised the ending of drought with the release of the waters of  the springs (
     <em>
      pegai
     </em>
     ) and growth of the golden (
     <em>
      khryse
     </em>
     ) blades of grain.  in Homeric poetry, Demeter was also titled Khrysaoros, further suggesting a close link between the name and blades of corn.
