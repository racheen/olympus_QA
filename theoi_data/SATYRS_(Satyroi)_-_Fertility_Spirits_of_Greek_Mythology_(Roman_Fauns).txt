   SATYRS (Satyroi) - Fertility Spirits of Greek Mythology (Roman Fauns)
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Satyrs were rustic fertility spirits of the countryside and wilds. They consorted with the Nymphs and were companions of the gods Dionysus, Hermes, Hephaestus, Pan, Rhea-Cybele and Gaea. Satyrs were depicted as animalistic men with asinine ears, pug noses, reclining hair-lines, the tails of horses and erect members. As companions of Dionysus they were usually shown drinking, dancing, playing flutes and sporting with the Maenads. The Romans called them Fauns." name="description"/>

     THE SATYROI (Satyrs) were rustic fertility spirits of the countryside and wilds. They consorted with the
     <a href="../Nymphe/Nymphai.html">

     (Nymphs) and were companions of the gods

     Satyroi were depicted as animalistic men with asinine ears, pug noses, reclining hair-lines, the tails of horses and erect members. As companions of Dionysos they were usually shown drinking, dancing, playing  flutes and sporting with the Mainades (Maenads).

    </p>

     Actors dressed as Satyroi formed the choruses of the so-called Satyr-plays which were performed at the festivals of the god Dionysos.

    <p>
     SA′TYRUS (Saturos), the name of a class of beings in Greek mythology, who are inseparably connected with the worship of Dionysus, and represent the luxuriant vital powers of nature. In their appearance they somewhat resembled goats or rams, whence many ancients believed that the word saturos was identical with tituros, a ram. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit.
     </em>
     iii. 2, vii. 72; Aelian,
     <em>
      V. H.
     </em>
     iii. 40; comp. Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1157; Hesych.
     <em>
      s. v.;
     </em>
     and Strab. x. p. 466.) Homer does not mention any Satyr, while Hesiod (
     <em>
      Fragm. 94,
     </em>
     ed. Göttling) speaks of them in the plural and describes them as a race good for nothing and unfit for work, and in a passage quoted by Strabo (x. p. 471) he states that the Satyrs, Nymphs and Curetes were the children of the five daughters of Hecataeus and the daughter of Phoroneus. The more common statement is that the Satyrs were the sons of Hermes and Iphthima (Nonn.
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xiv. 113), or of the Naiads (Xenoph.
     <em>
      Sympos.
     </em>
     v. 7); Silen also calls them his own sons. (Eurip.
     <em>
      Cycl.
     </em>
     13, 82, 269.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The appearance of the Satyrs is described by later writers as robust, and rough, though with various modifications, but their general features are as follows: the hair is bristly, the nose round and somewhat turned upwards, the ears pointed at the top like those of animals (whence they are sometimes called thêres, Eurip.
     <em>
      Cycl. 624
     </em>
     ); they generally have little horns, or at least two hornlike protuberances (phêrea), and at or near the end of the back there appears a little tail like that of a horse or a goat. In works of art they were represented at different stages of life; the older ones, commonly called Seilens or Silens (Paus. i. 23. § 6), usually have bald heads and beards, and the younger ones are termed Satyrisci (Saturiskoi, Theocrit. iv. 62, xxvii. 48). All kinds of satyrs belong to the retinue of Dionysus (Apollod. iii. 5. § 1; Strab. x. p. 468; Ov.
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     iii. 737,
     <em>
      Ars Am.
     </em>
     i. 542, iii. 157), and are always described as fond of wine, whence they often appear either with a cup or a thyrsus in their hand (Athen. xi. p. 484), and of every kind of sensual pleasure, whence they are teen sleeping, playing musical instruments or engaged in voluptuous dances with nymphs. (Apollod. ii. 1. § 4; Horat.
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     ii. 19. 3, i. 1. 30; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 692, xiv. 637; Philostr.
     <em>
      Vit. Apoll.
     </em>
     vi. 27 ; Nonn.
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xii. 82.) Like all the gods dwelling in forests and fields, they were greatly dreaded by mortals. (Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     vi. 13; Theocrit. xiii. 44; Ov.
     <em>
      Her.
     </em>
     iv. 49.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Later writers, especially the Roman poets, confound the Satyrs with the Pans and the Italian Fauns, and accordingly represent them with larger horns and goats' feet (Horat.
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     ii. 19. 4; Propert. iii. 15. 34; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 193, vi. 392, xiv 637), although originally they were quite distinct kinds of beings, and in works of art, too, they are kept quite distinct. Satyrs usually appear with flutes, the thyrsus, syrinx, the shepherd staff, cups or bags filled with wine; they are dressed with the skins of animals, and wear wreaths of vine, ivy or fir. Representations of them are still very numerous, but the most celebrated in antiquity was the Satyr of Praxiteles at Athens (Paus. i. 20. § 1; Plin.

     The Choruses of the ancient satyr-plays were composed of men dressed as Satyrs. The only surviving example of its kind is the fragmentary
     <em>
      Ichneutae
     </em>
     (Trackers) of Sophocles. A few fragments of some of Aeschylus' and Euripides satyr-dramas also survive. Many Athenian vase-paintings from the era depict scenes from these plays, for example, the Satyr-biga scene (shown above) likely represents a scene from Aeschylus' satyr-play

Playful Satyroi (Satyrs) lifted their heels in air, and tumbled plunging headover into the river; one selfpropelled swam with paddling hands prone on the waves, and imprinted a footstep on the swell, as he pushed with backstretching legs and cut the water rolling in riches; one dived deep down into the underwater caves and hunted for speckled fishy prey down below, stretching a groping hand over the swimming fry--left the deeps again and offered to Bakkhos [Dionysos] the fish purpled with the slime of the opulent river. Seilenos (Silenus) the old vagabond, challenging a Satyros, entwined hands and feet together, and rolling himself into a ball stooped and dived head first into the stream, from the heights into the deeps, till his hair stuck in the slime; then he trod his two feet firmly into the glittering sand hunting for good nuggets or ore in the river.

  Springheel Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos] cried his summons aloud, and first up leapt windfoot [Seilenos (Silen)] Leneus (Winepress), then on either side of him highstepping Kissos (Cissus, Ivy) and charming Ampelos (Ampelus, Vine) stood up. They stood in a row, confident in the quick soles of their straightfaring feet. Kissos flew with stormy movement of his feet just skimming the top of the ground as he touched it. Leneus was running behind him quick as the winds of heaven and warming the back of the sprinter with his breath, close behind the leader, and he touched footstep with footstep on the dust as it dropped, with following feet: the space between them both was no more than the rod leaves open before the bosom of a girl working at the loom, close to the firm breast. Ampelos came third and last. Dionysos saw them out of the corner of his eye, and melted with jealousy that the two competitors should be in front, afraid they might win and Ampelos [his love] come in behind them; so the god helped him, breathed strength into him, and made the boy swifter than the spinning gale. Then Kissos, first of the two in the race, striving so hard for the prize, stumbled over a wet place on the shore, slipt and fell in the sandy slush; Leneus had to check the course of his feet, and his knees lost their swing: so both competitors were passed and Ampelos carried off the victory.

     The old Seilenoi (Silenus) shouted Euoi! Amazed at the victory of the youth. He received the first prize with soft hair flowing, Leneus took the second full of envy, for he understood the jealous trick of Lyaios and his passion; Kissos eyed his comrades with look abashed, as he held out his hand for the last prize discontented."

     "[Dionysos discovers wine :] When Bakkhos (Bacchus) saw the [wild] grapes with a bellyful of red juice, he bethought him of an oracle which prophetic Rheia had spoken long ago. He dug into the rock, he hollowed out a pit in the stone with the sharp prongs of his earth-burrowing pick, he smoothed the sides of the deepening hold and made an excavation like a winepress; then he made his sharp thyrsus into the cunning shape of the later sickle with curved edge, and reaped the newgrown grapes.
     <br/>
     A band of Satyroi (Satyrs) was with him: one stooped to gather the clusters, one received them into an empty vessel as they were cut, one pulled off the masses of green leaves from the bilbulous fruit and threw away the rubbish. Another without thyrsus or sharpened steel crouched bending forwards and spying for grapes, and put out his right hand towards the branches to pluck the fruit at the ends of the tangled vine, then Bakkhos (Bacchus) spread the fruitage in the pit he had dug, first heaping the grapes in the middle of the excavation, then arranging them in layers side by side like cornheaps on the threshing-floor, spread out the whole length of the hole. When he had got all into the hollowed place and filled it up to the brim, he trod the grapes with dancing steps. The Satyroi also, shaking their hair madly in the wind, learnt from Dionysos how to do the like. They pulled tight the dappled skins of fawns over the shoulder, they shouted the song of Bakkhos sounding tongue with tongue, crushing the fruit with many a skip of the foot, crying ‘Euoi!’ The wine spurted up in the grapefilled hollow, the runlets were empurpled; pressed by the alternating tread the fruit bubbled out red juice with white foam. They scooped it up with oxhorns, instead of cups which had not yet been seen, so that ever after the cup of mixed wine took this divine name of Winehorn.
     <br/>
     And one went bubbling the mindcharming drops of Bakkhos as he turned his wobbling feet in zigzag jerks, crossing right over left in confusion as he wetted his hairy cheeks with Bakkhos's drops. Another skipt up struck with a tippler's madness when he heard the horrid boom of the beaten drumskin. One again who had drunk too deeply of caredispellingwine purpled his dark beard with the rosy liquor. Another turning his unsteady took towards a tree espied a Nymphe half-hidden, unveiled, close at hand; and he would have crawled up he highest tree in the forest, feet slipping, hanging on by his toenails, had not Dionysos held him back. Near the fountains another driven by the insane impulse of drunken excitement, chased a naked Naias of the waters; he would have seized her with hairy hand as she swam, but she gave the slip and dived into deep water. To Dionysos alone had Rheia given the amethyst, which preserves the windedrinker from the tyranny of madness.
     <br/>
     Many of the horned Satyroi joined furiously in the festive dancing with sportive steps. One felt within him a new hot madness, the guide to love, and threw a hairy arm round a Bakkhanal (Bacchanal) girl's waist. One shaken by the madness of min-crazing drink laid hold of the girdle of a modest unwedded maid, and as she would have no love-making pulled her back by the dress and touched her rosy thighs from behind. Another dragged back a struggling mystic maiden while kindling the torch for the god's nightly dances, laid timid fingers upon her bosom and pressed the swelling circle of her firm breast."

And the horned Satyroi were commanded by these leaders: Poimenios (Poemenius, Pastoral) and Thiasos (Thiasus), Hypsikeros (Hypsicerus, Tall-horn) and Orestes (Mountain-dweller), and Phlegraios (Phlegraeus) with horned Napaios (Napaeus, of the Glen). There was Gemon, there was bold Lykon (Lycon, the Wolfish) armed; playful Phereus followed laughing tippling Petraios (Petraeus, of the Rocks), hillranging Lamis (of the Hollow) marched with Lenobios (Lenobius), and Skirtos (Scirtus) tripped along beside Oistros (Oestrus). With Pherespondos walked Lykos the loudvoiced herald, and Pronomos renowned for intelligence--all sons of Hermes, when he had joined Iphthime to himself in secret union. She was the daughter of Doros (Dorus), himself sprung from Zeus and a root of the race of Hellen, and Doros was ancestor whence came the Akhaian (Achaean) blood of the Dorian tribe. To these three, Eiraphiotes [Dionysos], entrusted the dignity of the staff of the heavenly herald, their father the source of wisdom. The whole tribe of Satyroi (Satyrs) is boldhearted while they are drunken with bumpers of wine; but in battle they are but braggarts who run away from the fight--hares in the battlefield, lions outside, clever dancers, ho know better than all the world how to ladle strong drink from the full mixing-bowl. Few of these have been men of war, to whom bold Ares has taught all the practice of the fray and how to manage a battalion. Here when Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos] prepared for war, some of them covered their bodies with raw oxhides, others fortified themselves with skins of shaggy lions, others put on the grim pelts of panthers, others equipped themselves with long pointed staves, others girt about their chests the skins of long-antlered stags dappled like stars in the sky. With these creatures, the two horns on the temples right and left strengthened their sharp points, and a scanty fluff grew on the top of the pointed skull over the crooked eyes. When they ran, the winged breezes blew back their two ears, stretched out straight and flapping against their hairy cheeks : behind them a horse's tail stuck out straight and lashed round their loins on either side."

  The warshout resounded together with the worship of Bromios, Euian tambours roared, trumpet blared with harp leading the combat and gathering the people, mingled gore with libation, confused bloodshed with dance."

The Panes had drunk no hot blood fresh from the veins of a lioness of the wilds, and rushed not swift as the wind frenzied into the conflict, but they were mild with fear : hesitating they pawed the ground with gentle noiseless hooves, and ceased the terrible leaps of their highland dance."

     Their leader into the forest of pines was Phaunos [Faunus] who was well practised in the secrets of the lonely thickets . . . Parties coming up would often meet, men on the hills traversing different mountain-paths. One saw them up aloft, out in front, coming down, crossing over, with feet wandering in all directions. The sticks were packed in bundles with ropes well twisted and fastened tight and trim, and laid on the mules' backs; the animals set out in lines, and the hooves rang on the mountain-paths as they hurried along, the surface of the sandy dust was burdened by heavy logs dragged behind. Satyroi (Satyrs) and Panes were busy; some cut wood with axes, some pulled it from tree after tree with their hands, or lifted trunks with untiring arms and rattled over the rocks with dancing feet."

     "Wishing to know better than most people who the Satyroi (Satyrs) are I have inquired from many about this very point. Euphemos the Karian (Carian) said that on a voyage to Italia he was driven out of his course by winds and was carried into the outer sea, beyond the course of seamen. He affirmed that there were many uninhabited islands, while in others lived wild men. The sailors did not wish to put in at the latter, because, having put in before, they had some experience of the inhabitants, but on this occasion they had no choice in the matter. The islands were called Satyrides by the sailors, and the inhabitants were red haired, and had upon their flanks tails not much smaller than those of horses. As soon as they caught sight of their visitors, they ran down to the ship without uttering a cry and assaulted the women in the ship. At last the sailors in fear cast a foreign woman on to the island. Her the Satyroi (Satyrs) outraged not only in the usual way, but also in a most shocking manner."

     "The city of the Rhodians lies on the eastern promontory of Rhodes . . . [and it] has been adorned with many votive offerings, which for the most part are to be found in the Dionysion (Temple of Dionysos) . . . and there are also the paintings of Protogenes, his Ialysos and also his Satyros (Satyr), the latter standing by a pillar, on top of which stood a male partridge. And at this partridge, as would be natural, the people were so agape when the picture had only recently been set up, that they would behold him with wonder but overlook the Satyros, although the latter was a very great success."

     "[A description of an ancient Greek statue :] On a Satyros (Satyr). There was a certain cave near Thebes in Egypt which resembled a shepherd's pipe, since as it followed its winding course in the depths of the earth it formed a natural spiral; for it did not take a straight course at the opening and then branch off into straight-running corridors, but winding about under the mountain it made a huge spiral, ending in a most difficult maze. In it was set up an image of a Satyros wrought in marble. He stood on a base in the attitude of one making ready to dance, and lifting the sole of his right foot backward he not only held a flute in his hand but also was being the first to leap up at its sound; though in reality the flute's note was not reaching the player's ear, nor yet was the flute endowed with voice, but the physical effect which flute-players experience had been transferred to the stone by the skill of the artist. You could have seen the veins standing out as though they were filled with a sort of breath, the Satyros drawing the air from his lungs to bring notes from the flute, the statue eager to be in action, and the stone entering upon strenuous activity--for it persuaded you that the power to blow the flute was actually inherent in it, and that the indication of breathing was the result of its own inner powers--finding a way to accomplish the impossible. The body had no trace of delicacy, but the hardness of the members had stolen away their beauty, making the form rugged with the symmetry of manly limbs. For though soft skin and dainty limbs befit a beautiful girl, the appearance of a Satyros is unkempt, as of a mountain spirit (
     <em>
      daimon oreios
     </em>
     ) that leaps in honour of Dionysos. The statue was wreathed with ivy, though the sculptor's art did not cull real berries from a meadow, nay, rather, it was the stone which for all its hardness spread out into sprays and encircled the hair, creeping back from the forehead till the ends met at the sinews of the neck. Pan stood beside him, delighting in the music of the flute and embracing Ekho (Echo), in fear, I suppose, lest the flute set in motion some musical sound and induce the Nymphe to make an echoing response to the Satyros."
