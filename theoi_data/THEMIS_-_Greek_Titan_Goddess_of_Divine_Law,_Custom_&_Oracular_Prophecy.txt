   THEMIS - Greek Titan Goddess of Divine Law, Custom &amp; Oracular Prophecy
  </title>
  <meta content="Themis was the ancient Greek Titan-goddess of divine law and order--the traditional rules of conduct first established by the gods. She was also a prophetic goddess who presided over the most ancient oracles, including Delphi. In this role, she was the divine voice who first instructed mankind in the primal laws of justice and morality, such as the precepts of piety, the rules of hospitality, good governance, conduct of assembly, and pious offerings to the gods. Themis was an early bride of Zeus and his first counsellor." name="description"/>

     THEMIS was the Titan goddess of divine law and order--the traditional rules of conduct first established by the gods. She was also a prophetic goddess who presided over the most ancient oracles, including Delphoi (Delphi). In this role, she was the divine voice (
     <em>
      themistes
     </em>
     ) who first instructed mankind in the primal laws of justice and morality, such as the precepts of piety, the rules of hospitality, good governance, conduct of assembly, and pious offerings to the gods. In Greek, the word
     <em>
      themis
     </em>
     referred to divine law, those rules of conduct long established by custom. Unlike the word
     <em>
      nomos
     </em>
     , the term was not usually used to describe laws of human decree.
    </p>
    <p>
     Themis was an early bride of
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     and his first counsellor. She was often represented seated beside his throne advising him on the precepts of divine law and the rules of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Themis was closely identified with
     <a href="../Olympios/Demeter.html">
      Demeter
     </a>
     Thesmophoros ("Bringer of Law"). Indeed Themis' six children, the spring-time Horai (Horae, Seasons) and death-bringing Moirai (Moirae, Fates), reflect the dual-functions of Demeter's own daughter
     <a href="../Khthonios/Persephone.html">
      Persephone
     </a>
     . Themis was also identified with
     <a href="../Protogenos/Gaia.html">
      Gaia
     </a>
     (Gaea, Earth) especially in the role of the oracular voice of earth.

     THEMIS (Themis). A daughter of Uranus (others say Helios, Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph. 129
     </em>
     ) and Ge, was married to Zeus, by whom she became the mother of the Horae, Eunomia, Dice (Astraea), Eirene, and the Moerae. (Hes.
     <em>
      Theog. 135, 901,
     </em>
     &amp;c.; Apollod. i. 3. § 1.) In the Homeric poems, Themis is the personification of the order of things established by law, custom, and equity, whence she is described as reigning in the assemblies of men (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     ii. 68, &amp;c.), and as convening, by the command of Zeus, the assembly of the gods. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xx. 4.) She dwells in Olympus, and is on friendly terms with Hera. (xv. 87, &amp;c.) This character of Themis was recognised in the fact that at Thebes she had a sanctuary in common with the Moerae and Zeus Agoraeus (Paus. ix. 25. § 4), and at Olympia in common with the Horae. (Paus. v. 14. § 8, 17. § 1; comp. Diod. v. 67.) Besides this she is also described as an ancient prophetic divinity, and is said to have been in possession of the Delphic oracle as the successor of Ge, and previous to Apollo. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 321, iv. 642; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 800; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 246; Apollod. i. 4. § 1 ; Paus. x. 5. § 3; Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     init.) The worship of Themis was established at Thebes, Olympia, Athens (Paus. i. 22. § 1), at Tanagra (ix. 22. § 1), and at Troezene, where an altar was dedicated to
     <em>
      the Themides.
     </em>
     (ii. 31. § 8.) Nymphs believed to be daughters of Zeus and Themis lived in a cave on the river Eridanus (Apollod. ii. 5. § 11 ; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Apollon. Rhod.
     </em>
     iv. 1396; Hesych.
     <em>
      s. v.
     </em>
     Themistiades), and the Hesperides also are called daughters of Zeus and Themis. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Hippol. 737.
     </em>
     ) She is often represented on coins resembling the figure of Athena with a cornucopia and a pair of scales. (Gellius, xiv. 46.)

     THEMIS GODDESS OF ASSEMBLIES
    </h3>
    <p>
     Themis was the goddess of assemblies, an extension of her role as the goddess of divine law. A king would hear petitions and rule on matters of law and justice at the assembly. She also presided over the division of the sacrificial feast, and by extension over the Olympian feasts of the gods.

She went everywhere, and told them to make their way to Zeus' house. There was no Potamos (River) who was not there, except only Okeanos (Oceanus), there was not any one of the Nymphai (Nymphs) who live in the lovely groves, and the springs of rivers and grass of the meadows, who came not.

But Hera passed by the others and accepted a cup from Themis (Divine Law) of the fair cheeks, since she had first come running to greet her and had spoken to her and addressed her in winged words: ‘Hera, why have you come? You seem like one who has been terrified. I know, it was the son of Kronos, your husband, frightened you.’

     In turn the goddess Hera of the white arms answered her : ‘Ask me nothing of this, divine (thea) Themis. You yourself know what his spirit is, how it is stubborn and arrogant. Preside still over the gods in their house, the feast's fair division. Yet so much may you hear, and with you all the immortals, how Zeus discloses evil actions, and I do not think the heart of all will be pleasured alike.’"

In it the poet states that the oracle belonged to Poseidon and Ge (Gaea, Earth) in common; that Ge gave her oracles herself, but Poseidon used Pyrkon (Pyrcon) as his mouthpiece in giving responses. The verses are these:--`Forthwith the voice of Khthonies uttered a wise word, And with her Pyrkon, servant of the renown Earthshaker.'

     "I [Prometheus], although advising them for the best, was unable to persuade the Titanes (Titans), children of Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) and Khthon (Chthon, Earth); but they, disdaining counsels of craft, in the pride of their strength thought to gain the mastery without a struggle and by force. Often my mother Themis, or Gaia (Gaea, Earth) (though one form, she had many names), had foretold to me the way in which the future was fated to come to pass. That it was not by brute strength nor through violence, but by guile that those who should gain the upper hand were destined to prevail. And though I argued all this to them, they did not pay any attention to my words."

     "When for marriage with Thetis there arose strife 'twixt Zeus and glorious Poseidon when each of the two gods would have her to be his lovely bride, for passion filled their hearts. But for them did the wisdom of the immortal gods not grant this union should come to pass, when to their ears came the prophetic oracle. For in their midst wise-counselled (
     <em>
      euboulos
     </em>
     ) Themis told that it was ruled of fate that the sea-goddess should bring forth a son, of strength mightier than his father, whose hand should launch a shaft more powerful than the bolt of thunder or the fearsome trident, if she wed with Zeus or with his brothers. ‘Leave,’ said she, ‘From this design, but with a mortal let her bed be blessed, and let her see her son dying in war. Like Ares shall he be in strength of arm and in fleetness of foot like to the lightning flash. In my word you would hear, grant that her marriage be for an honour given of heaven to Peleus, the son of Aiakos (Aeacus), who, so they tell, is of all men most righteous, dwelling upon Iolkos' (Iolcus') plain. And to the immortal cave of Kheiron (Chiron) let your bidding speedily take its way, nor let the ballot-leaves of strife be set amidst as twice by Nereus' daughter. But on the full-moon's eve let her for this hero unloose the lovely girdle of her pure maidenhood.’ Such words the goddess spoke to the children of Kronos (Cronus); and they nodded giving their assent with immortal brows. Nor was the fruit of these words cast away. For the two gods joined in their honours given to the wedding of maid Thetis."

My mother, Themis (Divine Law), or Gaia (Earth), one person, through of various names, had many times foretold to me, that not brute strength, not violence, but cunning must give victory to the rulers of the future. This I explained to them, with reasons--which they found not worth one moment's heed Then, of the courses open to me, it seemed best tot take my stand--my mother with me--at the side of Zeus, willing and welcome.

     V. PROPHECY OF DEUCALION'S  (DEUKALION) STONE-BORN MEN
    </h4>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-latin">
      Ovid, Metamorphoses 1. 318 &amp; 375 (trans. Melville) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "There a great mountain aims towards the stars its double peak, Parnasos, soaring high above the clouds; and there [during the Great Deluge that destroyed mankind] Deucalion, borne on a raft, with his dear wife [Pyrrha] beside, had grounded; all elsewhere the deluge whelmed. Praise and thanksgiving to the Mountain gods (Numina Montis) and the Nymphae Corycidae (Corycian Nymphs) they gave, and to the prophetess, Themis, then guardian of the oracle . . . 
  They wept together [for the destruction of mankind]; then resolved to pray to Powers above and heavenly guidance seek in oracles; and quickly, hand in hand, went to Cephisus' stream, whose current ran not limpid yet but in his wonted course, and there, in ritual due with holy water sprinkling their heads and clothes, they turned their steps towards the holy shrine (a pale scum fouled its roofs; the altars stood without flame). They reached the temple steps and then, prostrate, with timid lips both kissed the cold wet stone and said : ‘If righteous prayers may move and soften the Powers divine, may turn their wrath away, tell, holy Themis, by what art our race, now lost, may be restored: in they great mercy hear and grant succour to a world submerged.’
     <br/>
     The goddess, pitying, gave her answer : ‘Leave my temple, veil your heads, loosen your robes, and cast behind you your great mother's bones.’
     <br/>
     Long did they wait bewildered, until Pyrrha, breaking the silence first, refused assent and asked the goddess' pardon, not daring to offend her mother's ghost by violence to her bones. In vain they sought the hidden meaning, searching to and for the baffling words' blind coverts. Then at last Promethides [Deukalion (Deucalion)] calmed Epimethis [Pyrrha] with words of cheer : ‘Either my reasoning misleads me or in truth (since oracles are holy and will never counsel crime) the earth is our great mother and the stones within earth's body surely are the bones the oracle intends. These we must throw over our shoulders as Themis directs.’
     <br/>
     So he interpreted, and Titania's [Pyrrha's] heart was warmed, but still hope wavered, such distrust oppressed them both; and yet what harm to try? They leave the temple, veil their heads, ungird their robes and, as the oracle commanded, behind them, past their footprints, throw the stones. Those stones (who would believe did ancient lore not testify the truth?) gave up their hardness; their rigidness grew slowly soft and, softened, assumed a shape, and as they grew and felt a gentler nature's touch, a semblance seemed to appear, still indistinct, of human form, like the first rough-hewn marble of a statue, scarce modelled, or old uncouth images. The earthy part, damp with some trace of moisture was turned to flesh; what was inflexible and solid changed to bone; what in the stones had been the veins retained the name of veins. In a brief while, by Heaven's mysterious power, the stones the man had thrown were formed as men, those from the woman's hand reshaped as women. Hence we are hard, we children of the earth, and in our lives of toil we prove our birth."

And, at her suit, Jove shall foreclaim that gift of his stepdaughter [Hebe], and her sons shall be transformed from their infancy.’ As Themis, who foreknew the future, spoke these prophecies, a rumbling argument arose in heaven, the gods all grumbling why others should not be allowed to grant such gifts [rejuvenated youth]."
