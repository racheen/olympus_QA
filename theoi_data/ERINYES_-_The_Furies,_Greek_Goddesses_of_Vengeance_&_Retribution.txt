     THE ERINYES (Furies) were three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the natural order. They were particularly concerned with homicide, unfilial conduct, offenses against the gods, and perjury. A victim seeking justice could call down the curse of the Erinys upon the criminal. The most powerful of these was the curse of the parent upon the child--for the Erinyes were born of just such a crime, being sprung from the blood of
     <a href="../Protogenos/Ouranos.html">
      Ouranos (Uranus)
     </a>
     , when he was castrated by his son
     <a href="../Titan/TitanKronos.html">
      Kronos (Cronus)
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The wrath of the Erinyes manifested itself in a number of ways. The most severe of these was the tormenting madness inflicted upon a patricide or matricide. Murderers might suffer illness or disease; and a nation harbouring such a criminal, could suffer dearth, and with it hunger and disease. The wrath of the Erinyes could only be placated with the rite ritual purification and the completion of some task assigned for atonement.
    </p>
    <p>
     The goddesses were also servants of

     </a>
     and
     <a href="Persephone.html">
      Persephone
     </a>
     in the underworld where they oversaw the torture of criminals consigned  to the Dungeons of the Damned.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Erinyes were similar to if not the same as the

     They were depicted as ugly, winged women with hair, arms and waists entwined with poisonous serpents. The sisters wielded whips and were clothed either in the long black robes of mourners, or the short-length skirts and boots of huntress- maidens.

     EUME′NIDES (Eumenides), also called ERINNYES, and by the Romans FURIAE or DIRAE, were originally nothing but a personification of curses pronounced upon a guilty criminal. The name Erinnys, which is the more ancient one, was derived by the Greeks from the
     <em>
      erinô
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      ereunaô
     </em>
     , I hunt up or persecute, or from the Arcadian word
     <em>
      erinuô
     </em>
     , I am angry; so that the Erinnyes were either the angry goddesses, or the goddesses who hunt up or search after the criminal. (Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     499; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     ii. 45; Cic.
     <em>
      de Nat.
     </em>
     Deor. iii. 18.) The name Eumenides, which signifies "the well-meaning," or "soothed goddesses," is a mere euphemism, because people dreaded to call these fearful goddesses by their real name, and it was said to have been first given them after the acquittal of Orestes by the court of the Areiopagus, when tile anger of the Erinnyes had become soothed. (Soph.
     <em>
      Oed. Col.
     </em>
     128; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Oed. Col.
     </em>
     42; Suid.
     <em>
      s. v.
     </em>
     Eumenides.) It was by a similar euphemism that at Athens the Erinnyes were called semnai theai, or the venerable goddesses. (Paus. i. 28 § 6) Servius (
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 609) makes a distinction, according to which they bore the name Dirae, when they were conceived as being in heaven by the throne of Zeus, Furiae, when conceived as being on earth, and Eumenides, as beings of the lower world; but this seems to be a purely arbitrary distinction.

    <p>
     In the sense of
     <em>
      curse
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      curses,
     </em>
     the word Erinnys or Erinnyes is often used in the Homeric poems (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ix. 454, xxi. 412,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xi. 280), and Aeschylus (
     <em>
      Choeph.
     </em>
     406) calls the Eumenides Arai that is, curses. According to the Homeric notion, the Erinnyes, whom the poet conceives as distinct beings, are reckoned among those who inhabit Erebos, srwhere they rest until some curse pronounced upon a criminal calls them to life and activity. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ix 571,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xv. 234.) The crimes which they punish are disobedience towards parents, violation of the respect due to old age, perjury, murder, violation of the law of hospitality, and improper conduct towards suppliants. (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ix. 454, xv. 204, xix. 259,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     ii. 136, xvii. 475.) The notion which is the foundation of the belief in the Eumenides seems to be, that a parent's curse takes from him upon whom it is pronounced all peace of mind, destroys the happiness of his family. and prevents his being blessed with children. (Herod. iv. 149; Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     835.) As the Eumenides not only punished crimes after death, but during life on earth, they were conceived also as goddesses of fate, who, together with Zeus and the Moerae or Parcae, led such men as were doomed to suffer into misery and misfortunes. (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xix. 87,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xv. 234.) In the same capacity they also prevented man from obtaining too much knowledge of the future. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xix. 418.) Homer does not mention any particular names of the Erinnyes, nor does he seem to know of any definite number. Hesiod, who is likewise silent upon these points, calls the Erinyes the daughters of Ge, who conceived them in the drops of blood that fell upon her from the body of Uranus. (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     185; comp. Apollod. i. 1. § 4.) Epimenides called them the daughters of Cronos and Euonyme, and sisters of the Moerae (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph.
     </em>
     406; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Soph. Oed. Col.
     </em>
     42); Aeschylus (
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     321) calls them the daughters of Night; and Sophocles (
     <em>
      Oed. Col.
     </em>
     40, 106) of Scotos (Darkness) and Ge. (Comp. some other genealogies in Hygin
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     p. 1; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     vii. 327; Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     69. 2.) The Greek tragedians, with whom, as in the Eumenides of Aeschylus, the number of these goddesses is not limited to a few (Dyer, in the
     <em>
      Class. Museum,
     </em>
     vol. i. pp. 281-298; comp. Eurip.
     <em>
      Iphig. Taur.
     </em>
     970; Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 469), no particular name of any one Erinnys is yet mentioned, but they appear in the same capacity, and as the avengers of the same crimes, as before. They are sometimes identified with the Poenae, though their sphere of action is wider than that of the Poenae. From their hunting up and persecuting the cursed criminal, Aeschylus (
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     231,
     <em>
      Choeph.
     </em>
     1055) calls them kunes or kungetides. No prayer, no sacrifice, and no tears can moove them, or protect the object of their persecution (Aesch.
     <em>
      Agam.
     </em>
     69,
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     384); and when they fear lest the criminal should escape them, they call in the assistance of Dicé, with whom they are closely connected, the maintenance of strict justice being their only object. (Aesch.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     511, 786; Orph. Argon. 350; Plut.
     <em>
      de Eail.
     </em>
     11.) The Erinnyes were more ancient divinities than the Olympian gods, and were therefore not under the rule of Zeus, though they honoured and esteemed him (
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     918, 1002); and they dwelt in the deep darkness of Tartarus, dreaded by gods and men. Their appearance is described by Aeschylus as Gorgo-like, their bodies covered with black, serpents twined in their hair, and blood dripping from their eyes; Euripides and other later poets describe them as winged beings. (
     <em>
      Orest.
     </em>
     317,
     <em>
      Iphig. Taur.
     </em>
     290; Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     xii. 848; Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     68. 5.) The appearance they have in Aeschylus was more or less retained by the poets of later times; but they gradually assumed the character of goddesses who punished crimes after death, and seldom appeared on earth. On the stage, however, and in works of art, their fearful appearrance was greatly softened down, for they were represented as maidens of a grave and solemn mien, in the richly adorned attire of huntresses, with a band of serpents around their heads, and serpents or torches in their hands. With later writers, though not always, the number of Eumenides is limited to three, and their names are Tisiphone, Alecto, and Megaera. (Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     68; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph.
     </em>
     406; Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     xii. 845.) At Athens there were statues of only two. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Oed. Col.
     </em>
     42.) The sacrifices which were offered to them consisted of black sheep and nephalia,
     <em>
      i. e.
     </em>
     a drink of honey mixed with water. (Schol.
     <em>
      l. c.;
     </em>
     Paus. ii. 11. § 4; Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     107.) Among the things sacred to them we hear of white turtledoves, and the narcissus. (Aelian,
     <em>
      H. A.
     </em>
     x. 33; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 87.) They were worshipped at Athens, where they had a sanctuary and a grotto near the Areiopagus : their statues, however, had nothing formidable (Paus. i. 28. § 6), and a festival Eumenideia was there celebrated in their honour. Another sanctuary, with a grove which no one was allowed to enter, existed at Colonus. (Soph.
     <em>
      Oed. Col.
     </em>
     37.) Under the name of Maniai, they were worshipped at Megalopolis. (Paus. viii. 34. § 1.) They were also worshipped on the Asopus and at Ceryneia. (Paus. ii. 11. § 4, vii. 25. § 4.)

  Tisiphone, dishevelled as she was, shook her white hair and tossed aside the snakes that masked her face . . . malign Tisiphone seized a torch steeped in blood, put on a robe all red with dripping gore and wound a snake about her waist . . . 
  The baleful Erinys stood . . . stretching her arms entwined with tangled snakes, and shaking out her hair. The snakes, dislodged, gave hissing sounds; some crawled upon her shoulders; some, gliding round her bosom, vomited a slime of venom, flickering their tongues and hissing horribly. Then from her hair she tore out two with a doom-charged aim darted them. Down the breasts of Athamas and Ino, winding, twisting, they exhaled their noisome breath; yet never any wound to see, the fateful fangs affect their minds. Tisiphone brought with her poisons too of magic power: lip-froth of Cerberus, the Echidna's venom, wild deliriums, blindnesses of the brain, and crime and tears, and maddened lust for murder; all ground up, mixed with fresh blood, boiled in a pan of bronze, and stirred with a green hemlock stick. And while they shuddered there, she poured the poisoned brew, that broth of madness, over both their breasts right down into their hearts. Then round and round she waved her torch, fire following brandished fire . . . She went, and loosed the snake she'd fastened round her waist."

From her shoulders falls a stark and grisly robe, whose dark fastenings meet upon her breast: Atropos [one of the Fates] and Proserpine [Persephone] fashion her this garb anew. Then both her hands are shaken in wrath, the one gleaming with a funeral torch, the other lashing the air with a live water-snake.

And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the Akheron (Acheron) and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's (Charon's) skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the Erinyes], and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings [i.e. in Haides], and for their good deeds they receive rewards [i.e. in Elysion (Elysium)], each according to his merits. But those who appear to be incurable, on account of the greatness of their wrongdoings, because they have committed many great deeds of sacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders, or any other such crimes, are cast by their fitting destiny into Tartaros, whence they never emerge. Those, however, who are curable, but are found to have committed great sin--who have, for example, in a moment of passion done some act of violence against father or mother and have lived in repentance the rest of their lives, or who have slain some other person under similar conditions--these must needs be thrown into Tartaros, and when they have been there a year the wave casts them out, the homicides by way of Kokytos (Cocytus), those who have outraged their parents by way of Pyriphlegethon. And when they have been brought by the current to the Akherousian (Acherusian) lake, they shout and cry out, calling to those whom they have slain or outraged, begging and beseeching them to be gracious and to let them come out into the lake; and if they prevail they come out and cease from their ills, but if not, they are borne away again to Tartaros and thence back into the rivers, and this goes on until they prevail upon those whom they have wronged; for this is the penalty imposed upon them by the judges."
