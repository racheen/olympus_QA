     SELENE was the Titan goddess of the moon. She was depicted as a woman riding sidesaddle on a horse or driving a chariot drawn by a pair of winged steeds. Her lunar sphere or crescent was either a crown set upon her head or the fold of a raised, shining cloak. She was sometimes said to drive a team of oxen and her lunar crescent was likened to a pair of bull's horns.
    </p>
    <p>
     Selene's great love was the shepherd prince
     <a href="../Heros/Endymion.html">
      Endymion
     </a>
     . The beautiful boy was granted eternal youth and immortality by Zeus and placed in a state of eternal slumber in a cave near the peak of Lydian Mount Latmos (Latmus). His heavenly bride consorted with him there in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     A number of other goddesses were also associated with the moon, however, only Selene was represented by the old Greek poets represented as the moon incarnate. Other Greek moon goddesses  included

    <p>
     SELE′NE (Selênê), also called Mene, or Latin Luna, was the goddess of the moon, or the moon personified into a divine being. She is called a daughter of Hyperion and Theia, and accordingly a sister of Helios and Eos (Hes.
     <em>
      Theog. 371,
     </em>
     &amp;c.; Apollod. i. 2. § 2; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Isthm.
     </em>
     v. 1,
     <em>
      ad Apollon. Rhod.
     </em>
     iv. 55); but others speak of her as a daughter of Hyperion by Euryphaessa (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. 31. 5
     </em>
     ), or of Pallas (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Merc. 99,
     </em>
     &amp;c.), or of Zeus and Latona (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Phoen. 175
     </em>
     ), or lastly of Helios (Eurip.
     <em>
      l.c.;
     </em>
     comp. Hygin.
     <em>
      Praef.
     </em>
     p. 10, ed. Muncker). She is also called Phoebe, as the sister of Phoebus, the god of the sun. By Endymion, whom she loved, and whom she sent to sleep in order to kiss him, she became the mother of fifty daughters (Apollod. i. 7. § 5; Cic.
     <em>
      Tusc.
     </em>
     i. 38; Catull. 66. 5; Paus. v. 1. § 2); by Zeus she became the mother of Pandeia, Ersa, and Nemea (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. 32. 14 ;
     </em>
     Plut.
     <em>

     iii. in fin.; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Nem.
     </em>
     Hypoth. p. 425, ed. Böckh). Pan also is said to have had connexion with her in the shape of a white ram (Virg.
     <em>
      Georg.
     </em>
     iii. 391). Selene is described as a very beautiful goddess, with long wings and a golden diadem (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. 32. 1, 7
     </em>
     ), and Aeschylus (
     <em>
      Sept. 390
     </em>
     ) calls her the eye of night. She rode, like her brother Helios, across the heavens in a chariot drawn by two white horses, cows, or mules (Ov.
     <em>

     </em>
     iii. 403; Nonn.
     <em>

     </em>
     vii. 244). She was represented on the pedestal of the throne of Zeus at Olympia, riding on a horse or a mule (Paus. v. 11. § 3); and at Elis there was a statue of her with two horns (Paus. vi. 24. § 5). In later times Selene was identified with Artemis, and the worship of the two became amalgamated (Callim.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Dian. 114, 141 ;
     </em>
     Soph.

     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 511, vi. 118). In works of art, however, the two divinities are usually distinguished; the face of Selene being more full and round, her figure less tall, and always clothed in a long robe; her veil forms an arch above her head, and above it there is the crescent. At Rome Luna had a temple on the Aventine. (Liv. xl. 2; Ov.

     Selene was the mother of the goddesses Pandia (All-Gifts), Ersa (Dew), the Menai (Menae, Months), and some say of the four Horai (Horae, Seasons). Her only mortal child was the poet Mousaios (Musaeus).

     [N.B. Virgil is probably alluding to the story of Selene's seduction by the shepherd Endymion. The name Pan is most likely used metaphorically, i.e. as the god of the flocks he was the source of the fine fleece which Endymion used to entice the goddess. A vase painting depicts Endymion waving such a fleece before the goddess' chariot. Alternatively, the story might be derived from a play on the Greek word,
     <em>
      panselênê

     Lunar eclipses and the phenomena of the "red moon" were  believed to be caused by the evil magics of Thessalian witches, who drew the goddess down from the sky in order to extract her blood. It was customary for villagers to beat cymbals at these times, to negate the witches' power and restore the goddess to the sky.

     "Dionysos (Dionysus) waited for darksome night, and appealed in these words to circle Mene (Moon) [Selene] in heaven : ‘O daughter of Helios (the Sun), Mene of many turnings, nurse of all! O Selene, driver of the silver car! 
  If thou art Hekate (Hecate) of many names, if in the night thou doest shake thy mystic torch in brandcarrying hand, come nightwanderer . . . If thou art staghunter Artemis, if on the hills thou dost eagerly hunt with fawnkilling Dionysos, be thy brother's helper now! . . . I am being chased out of Thebes [by Pentheus] . . . a mortal man, a creature quickly perishing, an enemy of god, persecutes me. As a being of night, help Dionysos of the night, when they pursue me! If thou art Persephoneia, whipperin of the dead, and yours are the ghosts which are subservient to the throne of Tartaros, let me see Pentheus a dead man, and let Hermes thy musterer of ghosts lull to sleep the tears of Dionysos in his grief. With Tartarean whip of thy Tisiphone, or furious Megaira (Megaera), stop the foolish threats of Pentheus . . .’
     <br/>
     To this appeal Mene [Selene] answered on high : ‘Night-illuminating Dionysos, friend of plants, comrade of Mene, look to your grapes; my concern is the mystic rites of Bakkhos (Bacchus), for the earth ripens the offspring of your plants when it receives the dewy sparkles of unresting Selene. Then do you, dancing Bakkhos, stretch out your thyrsos and look to your offspring; and you need not fear a race of puny men, whose mind is light, whose threats the whips of the Eumenides [Erinyes] repress perforce. With you I will attack your enemies. Equally with Bakkhos I rule distracted madness. I am the Bakkhic Mene, not alone because in heaven I turn the months, but because I command madness and excite lunacy. I will not leave unpunished earthly violence against you . . .’
     <br/>
     Such was the answer of the goldenrein deity to Bromios. But while Bakkhos yet conversed with circling Mene, even then Persephone was arming her Erinyes."
