   HELIUS (Helios) - Greek Titan God of the Sun (Roman Sol)
  </title>
  <meta content="Helius was the ancient Greek Titan god of the sun, the guardian of oaths and the god of sight. He dwelt in a golden palace located in the River Oceanus at the ends of the earth and from there emerged each dawn driving a chariot drawn by four, fiery winged steeds and crowned with the aureole of the sun. When he reached the the land of the Hesperides in the West he descended into a golden cup which carried him around the northern streams of Oceanus back to his rising place in the East. His Roman name was Sol." name="description"/>

      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 176,
     <em>
      Hymn. in Cer.
     </em>

     i. 24, ii. 19, 398,
     <em>
      Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth.
     </em>
     191.) In the Homeric hymn on Helios, he is called a son of Hyperion and Euryphaëssa. Homer describes Helios as giving light both to gods and men: he rises in the east from Oceanus, though not from the river, but from some lake or bog (limnê) formed by Oceanus, rises up into heaven, where he reaches the highest point at noon time, and then he descends, arriving in the evening in the darkness of the west, and in Oceanus. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     vii. 422,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     iii. 1, &amp;c., 335, iv. 400, x. 191, xi. 18, xii. 380.) Later poets have marvellously embellished this simple notion: they tell of a most magnificent palace of Helios in the east, containing a throne occupied by the god, and surrounded by personifications of the different divisions of time (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ii. 1, &amp;c.); and while Homer speaks only of the gates of Helios in the west, later writers assign to him a second palace in the west, and describe his horses as feeding upon herbs growing in the islands of the blessed. (Nonn.
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xii. 1, &amp;c.; Athen. vii. 296; Stat.
     <em>
      Theb.
     </em>
     iii. 407.) The points at which Helios rises and descends into the ocean are of course different at the different seasons of the year; and the extreme points in the north and south, between which the rising and setting take place, are the tropai êelioio. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xv. 403; Hes.
     <em>
      Op. et Dies,
     </em>
     449, 525.) The manner in which Helios during the night passes front the western into the eastern ocean is not mentioned either by Homer or Hesiod, but later poets make him sail in a golden boat round one-half of the earth, and thus arrive in the east at the point from which he has to rise again. This golden boat is the work of Hephaestus. (Athen. xi. 469; Apollod. ii. 5. § 10; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1632.) Others represent him as making his nightly voyage while slumbering in a golden bed. (Athen. xi. 470.) The horses and chariot with which Helios makes his daily career are not mentioned in the Iliad and Odyssey, but first occur in the Homeric hymn on Helios (9, 15; comp.
     <em>
      in Merc.
     </em>
     69,
     <em>
      in Cer.
     </em>
     88), and both are described minutely by later poets. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ii. 106, &amp;c.; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.

     </em>
     3 ; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     vii. 71.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Helios is described even in the Homeric poems as the god who sees and hears every thing, but, notwithstanding this, he is unaware of the fact that the companions of Odysseus robbed his oxen, until he was informed of it by Lampetia. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 375.) But, owing to his omniscience, he was able to betray to Hephaestus the faithlessness of Aphrodite, and to reveal to Demeter the carrying off of her daughter. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     viii. 271,
     <em>
      Hymn. in Cer. 75,
     </em>
     &amp;c.,
     <em>
      in Sol.
     </em>
     10; comp. Soph.
     <em>
      Ajax,
     </em>
     847, &amp;c.) This idea of Helios knowing every thing, which also contains the elements of his ethical and prophetic nature, seems to have been the cause of Helios being confounded and identified with Apollo, though they were originally quite distinct; and the identification was, in fact, never carried out completely, for no Greek poet ever made Apollo ride in the chariot of Helios through the heavens, and among the Romans we find this idea only after the time of Virgil. The representations of Apollo with rays around his head, to characterise him as identical with the sun, belong to the time of the Roman empire.
    </p>
    <p>
     The island of Thrinacia (Sicily) was sacred to Helios, and he there had flocks of oxen and sheep, each consisting of 350 heads, which never increased or decreased, and were attended to by his daughters Phaetusa and Lampetia. (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 128. 261, &amp;c.; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 965, &amp;c.) Later traditions ascribe to him flocks also in the island of Erytheia (Apollod. i. 6. § 1; comp. ii. 5. § 10 ; Theocrit. xxv. 130), and it may be remarked in general, that sacred flocks, especially of oxen, occur in most places where the worship of Helios was established. His descendants are very numerous, and the surnames and epithets given him by the poets are mostly descriptive of his character as the sun. Temples of Helios (êlieia) seem to have existed in Greece at a very early time (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 346), and in later times we find his worship established in various places, as in Elis (Paus. vi. 25. § 5), at Apollonia (Herod. ix. 93), Hermione (Paus. ii. 34. § 10), in the acropolis of Corinth (ii. 4. § 7; comp. ii. 1. § 6), near Argos (ii. 18. § 3), at Troezene (ii. 31. § 8), Megalopolis (viii. 9. § 2, 31. § 4), and several other places, especially in the island of Rhodes, where the famous colossus of Rhodes was a representation of Helios: it was 70 cubits in height, and, being overthrown by an earthquake, the Rhodians were commanded by an oracle not to erect it again. (Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     vii. 54, &amp;c.; Strab. xiv. p. 652; Plin.
     <em>
      H. N.
     </em>
     xxxiv. 7, 17.) The sacrifices offered to Helios consisted of white rams, boars, bulls, goats, lambs, especially white horses, and honey. (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xix. 197; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     pp. 36,1668; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     223; Paus. iii. 20. § 5; Herod. i. 216; Strab. xi. 513.) Among the animals sacred to him, the cock is especially mentioned. (Paus. v. 25. § 5.) The Roman poets, when speaking of the god of the sun (Sol), usually adopt the notions of the Greeks, but the worship of Sol was introduced also at Rome, especially after the Romans had become acquainted with the East, though traces of the worship of the sun and moon occur at a very early period. (Varro,
     <em>

     v. 74; Dionys. ii. 50; Sext. Ruf.
     <em>

     </em>
     iv.) Helios was represented on the pedestal of the Olympian Zeus, in the act of ascending his chariot (Paus. v. 11. § 3), and several statutes of him are mentioned (vi. 24. § 5, viii. 9. § 2, 31. § 4); he was also represented riding in his chariot, drawn by four horses. (Plin.

     In the early days of the cosmos when Ouranos (Uranus, Heaven) and Gaia (Gaea, Earth) had been driven apart by the Titanes (Titans), Helios (Helius) the sun-god shone upon the earth for the first time for the first time upon the earth. and from the warm, bubbling mud sprouted new life--plants and animals.

      Homeric Hymn 2 to Demeter 19 ff (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th or 6th B.C.) :

     "[Haides seized Persephone and carried her off to the underworld :] Then she [Persephone] cried out shrilly with her voice, calling upon her father [Zeus]  . . . No one, either of the deathless gods or mortal men, heard her voice, nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit: only [Hekate (Hecate)] . . . heard the girl from her cave, and the bright lord Helios (Helius) Hyperionides (the Sun) . . .
     <br/>
     [Demeter, accompanied by Hekate, went in search of her stolen daughter :] They came to Helios (the Sun), who is watchman of both gods and men, and stood in front of his horses : and the bright goddess enquired of him : ‘Helios, do you at least regard me, goddess as I am, if ever by word or deed of mine I have cheered your heart and spirit. Through the fruitless air (
     <em>
      aitheros
     </em>
     ) I heard the thrilling cry of my daughter whom I bare, sweet scion of my body and lovely in form, as of one seized violently; though with my eyes I saw nothing. But you--for with your beams you look down from the bright upper air (aitheros) over all the earth and sea--tell me truly of my dear child if you have seen her anywhere, what god or mortal man has violently seized her against her will and mine, and so made off.’
     <br/>
     So said she. And Hyperionides [Helios] answered her : ‘Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rheia, I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter. None other of the deathless gods is to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Aides [Haides], her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife. And Aides seized her and took her loudly crying in his chariot down to his realm of mist and gloom. Yet, goddess, cease your loud lament and keep not vain anger aunrelentingly: Aidoneus, the Ruler of Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also, for honour, he has that third share which he received when division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those among whome he dwells.’
     <br/>
     So he spake, and called to his horses : and at his chiding they quickly whirled the swift chariot along, like long-winged birds."

Helice replies this to her : ‘Night is guiltless. Consult Sol (the Sun) [Helios] on the virgin's rape. He gazes far and wide on the day's deeds.’ Sol (the Sun) is approached. ‘Don't waste time,’ he says, ‘You seek the bride of Jove's [Zeus'] brother [Haides], the third realm's queen.’"

At once he forged a net, a mesh of thinnest links of bronze, too fine for eye to see [with which he laid a trap for the lovers Aphrodite and Ares] . . . Cythereia [Aphrodite] did not forget.

Later she became nurse of Jove [Zeus], as we have said before. But when Jupiter [Zeus], confident in his youth, was preparing for war against the Titanes, oracular reply was given to him [presumably from Helios, Ouranos (Uranus) and Gaia, as above] that if he wished to win, he should carry on the war protected with the skin of a goat,

     <span class="quote-greek">
      Homer, Odyssey 12. 261 ff :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "When we [Odysseus and his men] had left the rocks behind us, with Skylla (Scylla) and terrible Kharybdis (Charybdis), we came soon enough to the lovely island of Helios. Here were the fine broad-browed herds, here were the plentiful fat flocks of Hyperion [Helios]. While the dark ship was still out at sea, I heard sheep bleating and cows lowing as they entered their quarters for the night; and into my heart came back the blind prophet's [Teiresias' (Tiresias') ] words and Aiaian Kirke's (Aeaean Circe's) also; both of them had enjoined me earnestly to shun this island of the all-gladdening Helios. Troubled at heart, I spoke to my comrades thus : ‘Comrades, listed to what I say, sad though your plight is; I must tell you of the prophetic words of Theban Teiresias and of Kirke. They urged me solemnly, both of them, to shun this island of the all-gladdening sun-god Helios, because there, they said, the direst of perils awaited us. Take heed then; row the dark vessel past this island.’
     <br/>
     So I spoke, and the men's hearts sank within them. Eurylokhos (Eurylochus) answered me at once [and with the other men insist that Odysseus land's the ship] . . . We beached our ship and dragged it up to a certain cave within whose hollows the Nymphai (Nymphs) could sit or weave their lovely dances. Then I called an assembly of my men and spoke thus among them : ‘Friends, in our ship we have food and drink enough. Let us keep our hands from the cattle, then, lest evil should overtake us; these beasts the cows and fat sheep, belong to the dread divinity, Helios the sun-god, who sees all things and hears all things.’
     <br/>
     So I spoke, and their own strong wills gave consent. Then for a whole month the south wind blew without ceasing  . . . [the men of Odysseus were starving, so the hero departed to pray in private to the gods.]
     <br/>
     Among my comrades Eurylokhos put forth evil counsel : ‘Comrades, in this sad plight of ours, hear what I have to say. Every form of death is loathsome to wretched mortals, but to perish of hunger, to starve to death - that is the most pitiful thing of all. Enough! Let us carry off the best of Helios' cattle and give them in sacrifice to the Deathless Ones whose home is wide heaven. And if ever we should return again to our own land, Ithaka, we will hasten to build a sumptuous temple to Hyperion the sun-god, and there we may place fine offerings in plenty. But if in anger over his long-horned cattle he resolves to wreck our ship and the other gods second him--why, then, I would rather drink the brine and lose life at one gulp than waste away by inches in this forsaken island.’
     <br/>
     So spoke Eurylokhos, and the rest of the crew applauded him. They drove off at once the best of Helios' cattle--it was near at hand, not far from the ship, that they were grazing, these handsome beasts with their broad brows and curling horns. The men surrounded them and began their prayer to the gods, and because they had no barley-meal in the ship, they plucked instead the fresh tender leaves of a tall oak. Prayer over, they slaughtered and flayed the cows, cut out the thigh-bones and covered them with a double fold of fat, then laid the raw meat above. They had no wine to make libation over the burning sacrifice, but instead poured water as they set to roasting the inward parts. When the thigh-bones were quite consumed and the entrails tasted, they sliced and spitted the rest.
     <br/>
     At that moment the sleep that had soothed me [Odysseus] passed of a sudden from my eyelids, and I took my way to the shore and ship again. Then, as I neared the curving vessel, the rich savour of roasting meat was wafted all about me. I groaned aloud, I cried out to the deathless gods : ‘Oh Father Zeus, oh blessed and ever-living gods, surely it was for my destruction that you lulled me with that fatal slumber, while the comrades that I left behind me devised this deed of unrighteousness.’
     <br/>
     But without delay Lampetie (Lampetia) of the trailing robe sped off to Hyperion [Helios] the sun god to tell him that we had slain his cattle, and he with his heart inflamed with anger spoke out at once to the Deathless Ones : ‘O Father Zeus, O blessed and ever-living gods, take vengeance on the crew of Laertes' son Odysseus; in their lawlessness they have slain the cattle in which I always took delight, both as I climbed the starry sky and as I took my path again back from the sky and down towards the earth. Unless these men pay a just atonement for my cattle, I will descend to Haides' kingdom and shine among the dead.’
     <br/>
     Zeus who masses the clouds made answer : ‘Helios, shine in the sight of the Deathless One and of mortals over the fertile earth. As for those you speak of, soon enough I will strike their ship with my white-hot thunderbolt and shatter and shiver it in mid-ocean.’
     <br/>
     All this I heard from Kalypso (Calypso) of the lovely hair, who herself heard it, so she told me, from Hermes, messenger of the gods. 
  When I reached the sea where the ship lay, I went round to the men one by one and upbraided them, but as for a remedy, there was none to be found; the cattle were killed already. Then the gods began to show signs and wonders to my crew. The beasts' hides began to move; the flesh on the spits, raw or roasted, began to bellow, and there was a noise like the noise of cattle [perhaps because the cattle were immortal and could not die]. 
  For six days more the crew still banqueted on the choice cattle that they had seized; but when Zeus brought us the seventh day, the wind and raging tempest ceased. So without delay we went aboard, stepped the mast, hauled the white sails and launched into wide ocean . . . [And then Zeus, as promised, sent a tempest, and destroyed the ship with a thunderbolt--only Odysseus survived.]"

But for Helios (Helius, the Sun) no lot was drawn; for he was absent, and they left him of broad earth no heritage, that holy god. And when he made known his mischance, Zeus was in mind to portion out the lots again; but he allowed him not, for he said that beneath the surge of sea his eyes had seen a land growing out of the depths, blessed with rich nourishment for men and happy with teeming flocks.

     And straightaway then the god commanded Lakhesis of the golden fillet to raise aloft her hands and swear, no on her lips alone, the great oath of the gods, promising with the son of Kronos (Cronus) [Zeus] this land once risen to the light of heaven should be thenceforth as for a crown of honour his own awarded title.

     "Helios (Helius), the myth tells us, becoming enamoured of Rhodos (Rhode) [daughter of Poseidon], named the island Rhodes after her and caused the water which had overflowed it to disappear. But the true explanation is that while in the first forming of the world the island was still like mud and soft, the sun dried up the larger part of its wetness and filled the land with living creatures, and there came into being the Heliadai (Heliadae, sons of Helios), who were named after him, seven in number ,and other peoples who were, like them, sprung from the land itself. In consequence of these events the island was considered to be sacred to Helios, and the Rhodians of later times made it their practice to honour Helios above all the other gods, as the ancestor and founder from whom they were descended. His seven sons were Okhimos (Ochimus), Kerkaphos (Cercaphus), Makar (Macar), Aktis (Actis), Tenages, Triopas, Kandalos (Candalus), and there was one daughter, Elektryone (Electryone), who quite this life while still a maiden and attained at the hands of the Rhodians to honours like those accorded to the heroes. And when the Heliadai attained to manhood they were told by Helios that the first people to offer sacrifice to Athene (Athena) would ever enjoy the presence of the goddess; and the same thing, we are told, was disclosed by him to the inhabitants of Attika (Attica)."

Boreas (the North Wind) first tried his power and blew with all his might, but the keener his blasts, the closer the traveler wrapped his cloak around him, until at last, resigning all hope of victory, the Wind called upon Helios (the Sun) to see what he could do. Helios (the Sun) suddenly shone out with all his warmth. The traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another, and at last, fairly overcome with heat, undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path. Persuasion is better than force."

     "Once upon a time, when Helios/Sol (the Sun) announced his intention to take a wife, the Frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky. Zeus/Jupiter, disturbed by the noise of their croaking, inquired the cause of their complaint. One of them said, ‘Helios/Sol (the Sun), now while he is single, parches up the marsh, and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes. What will be our future condition if he should beget other suns?’"
