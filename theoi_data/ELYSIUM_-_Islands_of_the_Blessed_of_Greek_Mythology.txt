   ELYSIUM - Islands of the Blessed of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In ancient Greek mythology and religion Elysium was the final resting place of the souls of heroes and virtuous men. The ancients often distinguished two Elysian realms--the islands of the Blessed and the Lethean fields of Hades. The first of these--also known as the White Island or the Islands of the Blessed--was an afterlife realm reserved for the heroes of myth. It was a paradise located in the far western stream of the river Oceanus ruled by the Titan-King Cronus or Rhadamanthys, son of Zeus. The second Elysium was an underworld realm separated from the gloom of Hades by the river Lethe. Its pleasant fields were promised as an afterlife to initiates of the Mysteries who had lived virtuous lives." name="description"/>

     ELYSION (Elysium) was the final resting place of the souls of heroes and virtuous men. The ancients often distinguished  two Elysian realms--the islands of the Blessed and the Lethean fields of Haides.
    </p>
    <p>
     The first of these--also known as the White Island or the Islands of the Blessed--was an afterlife realm reserved for the heroes of myth. It was an island paradise located in the far western stream of the
     <a href="Okeanos.html">
      river Okeanos (Oceanus)
     </a>
     ruled by the Titan-King
     <a href="../Titan/TitanKronos.html">
      Kronos (Cronus)
     </a>
     or
     <a href="../Khthonios/Rhadamanthys.html">
      Rhadamanthys
     </a>
     , son of Zeus.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second Elysium was an underworld realm separated from the gloom of Haides by the
     <a href="../Khthonios/PotamosLethe.html">
      river Lethe
     </a>
     . Its pleasant fields were promised as an afterlife to initiates of the Mysteries who had lived virtuous lives. The gods of the Mysteries associated with the passage to Elysium included

     (the Orphic Hekate) and
     <a href="../Khthonios/Makaria.html">
      Makaria
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     When the concept of reincarnation gained currency in the classical world the two Elysian realms were sometimes tiered--a soul which had  won passage three times to the netherworld Elysium would, with their fourth death, be transferred  to the Islands of the Blessed  to dwell with the heroes of myth for all eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
     It should be noted that Elysium was an evolving concept. Homer knows of no such realm and consigns all of his heroes to the common house of Haides, while Hesiod and many other poets speak only of a paradisal realm exclusively reserved for the heroes. Roman writers such as Virgil combine the two Elysia--the realm of the virtuous dead and the realm of heroes being one and the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few  late Greek writers attempted to rationalise the myth and identified the mythical White Island with one located near the mouth of the river Danube on the Black Sea and the Islands of the Blessed with certain islands in the Atlantic Ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     The terms Elysium and Haides  were adjectives rather than nouns in the ancient Greek language, for example,
     <em>
      pedion Elysion
     </em>
     (the Elysian plain) and
     <em>
      domos Haidou
     </em>
     (the house of Haides). The etymology of the word
     <em>
      elysion
     </em>
     is unclear. It may be derived from the Greek verb
     <em>
      eleusô
     </em>
     (
     <em>
      eleuthô
     </em>
     ) meaning "to relieve" or "release" (from pain or troubles) or was perhaps derived from the name of the town of Eleusis, site of the celebrated Eleusinian Mysteries.

The third island he settled was Kos (Cos) . . . and then he dispatched Leukippos (Leucippus), together with a large body of colonists, to Rhodes . . .

No snow is there, nor yet great storm, nor ever any rain; but always Okeanos (Oceanus) sendeth forth the breezes of clear-blowing Zephyros.’ For both the pure air and the gentle breezes of Zephyros (the West Wind) properly belong to this country, since the country is not only in the west but also warm; and the phrase 'at the ends of the earth' properly belongs to it, where Haides has been ‘mythically placed,’ as we say. And Homer's citing of Rhadamanthys suggests the region that is near Minos, concerning whom he says : ‘There it was I saw Minos, glorious son of Zeus, holding a golden scepter rendering decisions to the dead.’ Furthermore, the poets who came after Homeros keep dinning into our ears similar stories . . . even calling by name certain Islands of the Blest (

The people of Himera too agree with this account. In the Euxine [Black Sea] at the mouths of the Ister [i.e. the Danube] is an island sacred to Akhilleus. It is called White Island (

     The first to sail thither legend says was Leonymos of Krotona [historical figure late C7th, early C6th B.C.]. For when war had arisen between the people of Krotona and the Lokroi (Locri) in Italy, the Lokroi, in virtue of the relationship between them and the Opountians, called upon [the mythical Trojan war hero] Aias (Ajax) son of Oileus to help them in battle. So Leonymos the general of the people of Krotona attacked his enemy at that point where he heard that Aias was posted in the front line. Now he was wounded in the breast, and weak with his hurt came to Delphoi. When he arrived the Pythian priestess sent Leonynios to White Island, telling him that there Aias would appear to him and cure his wound.

     In time he was healed and returned from White Island, where, he used to declare, he saw Akhilleus, as well as Aias the son of Oileus and Aias the son of Telamon. With them, he said, were Patroklos (Patroclus) and Antilokhos (Antilochus); Helene was wedded to Akhilleus, and had bidden him sail to Stesikhoros (Stesichorus) at Himera [historical poet], and announce that the loss of his sight was caused by her wrath."

  Some of them delight themselves with horses and with wrestling; others with draughts, and with lures; while beside them bloometh the fair flower of perfect bliss.

     [N.B. According to Pindar after the death the soul is judged in Haides and, if found guiltless in life, passes to the subterranean Elysian fields. It must return twice again to earth and suffer two more deaths and if it remains virtuous through these three lifetimes, Persephone releases it a fourth time but this time to be born as a king, hero or sage. After this is it is finally freed from the cycle and passes  to the Islands of the Blessed in the river Okeanos--the final resting place of the greatest of souls.]

For if a man when he reaches the other world, after leaving behind these who claim to be judges [i.e. the Athenian judges who tried Sokrates], shall find those who are really judges who are said to sit in judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and Aiakos (Aeacus) and Triptolemos, and all the other demigods who were just men in their lives, would the change of habitation be undesirable? Or again, what would any of you give to meet with Orpheus and Musaios (Musaeus) and Hesiod and Homer? I am willing to die many times over, if these things are true; for I personally should find the life there wonderful, when I met Palamedes or Aias (Ajax), the son of Telamon, or any other men of old who lost their lives through an unjust judgement, and compared my experience with theirs. I think that would not be unpleasant. And the greatest pleasure would be to pass my time in examining and investigating the people there [i.e. in Elysium], as I do those here, to find out who among them is wise and who thinks he is when he is not. What price would any of you pay, judges, to examine him who led the great army against Troy, or Odysseus, or Sisyphos, or countless others, both men and women, whom I might mention? To converse and associate with them and examine them would be immeasurable happiness. At any rate, the folk there do not kill people for it; since, if what we are told is true, they are immortal for all future time, besides being happier in other respects than men are here."

      Plato, Gorgias 523a  (trans. Lamb) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "Now in the time of Kronos (Cronus) there was a law concerning mankind, and it holds to this very day amongst the gods, that every man who has passed a just and holy life departs after his decease to the Isles of the Blest (
     <em>
      Nesoi Makaron
     </em>
     ), and dwells in all happiness apart from ill; but whoever has lived unjustly and impiously goes to the dungeon of requital and penance which, you know, they call Tartaros (Tartarus). Of these men there were judges in Kronos' time, and still of late in the reign of Zeus--living men to judge the living upon the day when each was to breathe his last; and thus the cases were being decided amiss. So Plouton [Haides] and the overseers from the Isles of the Blest came before Zeus with the report that they found men passing over to either abode undeserving. Then spake Zeus : ‘Nay,’ said he, ‘I will put a stop to these proceedings. The cases are now indeed judged ill and it is because they who are on trial are tried in their clothing, for they are tried alive. Now many,’ said he, ‘who have wicked souls are clad in fair bodies and ancestry and wealth, and at their judgement appear many witnesses to testify that their lives have been just. Now, the judges are confounded not only by their evidence but at the same time by being clothed themselves while they sit in judgement, having their own soul muffled in the veil of eyes and ears and the whole body. Thus all these are a hindrance to them, their own habiliments no less than those of the judged.’
     <br/>
     ‘Well, first of all,’ he said, ‘we must put a stop to their foreknowledge of their death; for this they at present foreknow. However, Prometheus has already been given the word to stop this in them. Next they must be stripped bare of all those things before they are tried; for they must stand their trial dead. Their judge also must be naked, dead, beholding with very soul the very soul of each immediately upon his death, bereft of all his kin and having left behind on earth all that fine array, to the end that the judgement may be just. Now I, knowing all this before you, have appointed sons of my own to be judges; two from Asia, Minos and Rhadamanthys, and one from Europe, Aiakos (Aeacus). These, when their life is ended, shall give judgement in the meadow at the dividing of the road, whence are the two ways leading, one to the Isles of the Blest (
     <em>
      Nesoi Makaron
     </em>
     ), and the other to Tartaros. And those who come from Asia shall Rhadamanthys try, and those from Europe, Aiakos; and to Minos I will give the privilege of the final decision, if the other two be in any doubt; that the judgement upon this journey of mankind may be supremely just . . .’
     <br/>
     When a man's soul is stripped bare of the body, all its natural gifts, and the experiences added to that soul as the result of his various pursuits, are manifest in it. So when they have arrived in presence of their judge, they of Asia before Rhadamanthys, these Rhadamanthys sets before him and surveys the soul of each, not knowing whose it is . . . [and perceiving a wicked soul, he sends it to Tartaros.]
     <br/>
     Sometimes, when he discerns another soul that has lived a holy life in company with truth, a private man's or any others . . . he is struck with admiration and sends it off to the Isles of the Blest (
     <em>
      Nesoi Makaron
     </em>
     ). And exactly the same is the procedure of Aiakos : each of these two holds a rod in his hand as he gives judgement; but Minos sits as supervisor, distinguished by the golden scepter that he holds, as Odysseus in Homer tells how he saw him--‘Holding a golden scepter, speaking dooms to the dead.’"

As to their words, they are these : mark now, if you judge them to be true. They say that the soul of man is immortal, and at one time comes to an end, which is called dying, and at another is born again, but never perishes [i.e. the soul is reincarnated]. Consequently one ought to live all one's life in the utmost holiness. ‘For from whomsoever Persephone shall accept requital for ancient wrong, the souls of these she restores in the ninth year to the upper sun again; from them arise glorious kings and men of splendid might and surpassing wisdom, and for all remaining time are they called holy heroes amongst mankind.’" [N.B.

For the soul takes with it to the other world nothing but its education and nurture, and these are said to benefit or injure the departed greatly from the very beginning of his journey thither. And so it is said that after death, the tutelary genius (
     <em>
      daimon

     ) of each person, to whom he had been allotted in life, leads him to a place where the dead are gathered together [i.e. the

     guide is Plato's equivalent of Hermes Psykhopompos (Guide of the Dead)]; then they are judged [i.e. by the Judges of the Dead] and depart to the other world with the guide whose task it is to conduct thither those who come from this world; and when they have there received their due and remained through the time appointed, another guide brings them back after many long periods of time [i.e. they are reincarnated]. And the journey is . . . neither simple nor single, for if it were, there would be no need of guides, since no one could miss the way to any place if there were only one road. But really there seem to be many forks of the road and many windings; this I infer from the rites and ceremonies practiced here on earth [e.g. in the Eleusinian Mysteries]. Now the orderly and wise soul follows its guide and understands its circumstances . . . The soul which is impure and has done wrong, by committing wicked murders or other deeds akin to those . . . is carried by necessity to its fitting habitation [i.e. the prison of Tartaros]. But the soul that has passed through life in purity and righteousness, finds gods for companions and guides, and goes to dwell in its proper dwelling [i.e. the Elysian fields]."

And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the Akheron (Acheron) and, embarking upon vessels provided for them [i.e. the equivalent of Kharon's (Charon's) skiff], arrive in them at the lake; there they dwell and are purified [i.e. by the equivalent of the Erinyes], and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings [i.e. in Tartaros], and for their good deeds they receive rewards, each according to his merits [i.e. in Elysium].

Aeneas wins the entrance, sprinkles his body with fresh water, and plants the bough full on the threshold.
     <br/>
     This at length performed and the task of the goddess fulfilled, they came to a land of joy, the pleasant lawns and happy seats of the Blissful Groves. Here an ampler ether clothes the meads with roseate light, and they know their own sun, and stars of their own. Some disport their limbs on the grassy wrestling ground, vie in sports, and grapple on the yellow sand; some tread the rhythm of a dance and chant songs. There, too, the long-robed Thracian priest [Orpheus] matches their measures with the seven clear notes, striking the lyre now with his fingers, now with is ivory quill. Here is Teucer's [of Troy's] ancient line, family most fair, high-souled heroes born in happier years--Ilus and Assaracus and Dardanus, Troy's founder. From afar he marvels at their phantom arms and chariots. Their lances stand fixed in the ground, and their unyoked steeds browse freely over the plain. The same pride in chariot and arms that was theirs in life, the same care in keeping sleek steeds, attends them now that they are hidden beneath the earth. Others he sees, to right and left, feasting on the sward, and chanting in chorus a joyous paean within a fragrant laurel grove, from where the full flood of the Eridanus rolls upward through the forest.
     <br/>
     Here is the band of those who suffered wounds, fighting for their country; those who in lifetime were priests and pure, good bards, whose songs were meet for Phoebus [Apollon]; or they who ennobled life by arts discovered and they who by service have won remembrance among men--the brows of all bound with headbands white as snow. These, as they streamed round, the Sibylla thus addressed, Musaeus [a poet of the Orphic Mysteries] before all; for he is centre of that vast throng that gazes up to him, as with shoulders high he towers aloft : ‘Say, happy souls, and you, best of bards, what land, what place holds Anchises? For his sake are we come, and have sailed across the great rivers of Erebus.’ And to her the hero thus made brief reply : ‘None has a fixed home. We dwell in shady groves, and live on cushioned riverbanks and in meadows fresh with streams. But if the wish in your heart so inclines, surmount this ridge, and soon I will set you on an easy path.’ He spoke and stepped on before, and from above points out the shining fields. Then they leave the mountaintops.
     <br/>
     But deep in a green vale father Anchises was surveying with earnest thought the imprisoned souls that were to pass to the light above and, as it chanced, was counting over the full number of his people and beloved children, their fates and fortunes, their works and ways. And as he saw Aeneas coming towards him over the sward, he eagerly stretched forth both hands, while tears streamed from his eyes and a cry fell from his lips . . . [he greets his son.]
     <br/>
     Meanwhile, in a retired vale, Aeneas sees a sequestered grove and rustling forest thickets, and the river Lethe [the river of forgetfulness] drifting past those peaceful homes. About it hovered peoples and tribes unnumbered; even as when, in the meadows, in cloudless summertime, bees light on many-hued blossoms and stream round lustrous lilies and all the fields murmur with the humming. Aeneas is startled by the sudden sight and, knowing not, asks the cause--what is that river yonder, and who are the men thronging the banks in such a host? Then said father Anchises : ‘Spirits they are, to whom second bodies are owed by Fate, and at the water of Lethe's stream they drink the soothing draught and long forgetfulness. These in truth I have long yearned to tell and show you to your face, yea, to count this, my children's seed, that so you may rejoice with me the more at finding Italy.’ ‘But, father, must we think that any souls pass aloft from here to the world above and return a second time to bodily fetters? What mad longing for life possesses their sorry hearts?’ ‘I will surely tell you, my son, and keep you not in doubt,’ Anchises replies and reveals each truth in order.
     <br/>
     ‘First, know that heaven and earth and the watery plains the moon's bright sphere and Titan's star, a spirit within sustains; in all the limbs mind moves the mass and mingles with the mighty frame. Thence springs the races of man and beast, the life of winged creatures, and the monsters that ocean bears beneath his marble surface. Fiery is the vigour and divine the source of those seeds of life, so far as harmful bodies clog them not, or earthly limbs and frames born but to die. Hence their fears and desires, their griefs and joys; nor do they discern the heavenly light, penned as they are in the gloom of their dark dungeon. Still more! When life's last ray has fled, the wretches are not entirely freed from all evil and all the plagues of the body; and it needs must be that many a taint, long ingrained, should in wondrous wise become deeply rooted in their being. Therefore are they schooled with punishments, and pay penance for bygone sins. Some are hung stretched out to the empty winds; from others the stain of guilt is washed away under swirling floods or burned out by fire till length of days, when time's cycle is complete, has removed the inbred taint and leaves unsoiled the ethereal sense and pure flame of spirit: each of us undergoes his own purgatory. Then we are sent to spacious Elysium, a few of us to possess the blissful fields. All these that you see, when they have rolled time's wheel through a thousand years, the god summons in vast throng to Lethe's river, so that, their memories effaced, they may once more revisit the vault above and conceive the desire of return to the body.’

     Anchises paused, and drew his son and with him the Sibylla into the heart of the assembly and buzzing throng, then chose a mound whence he might scan face to face the whole of the long procession and note their faces as they came. ‘Now then, the glory henceforth to attend the Trojan race, what children of Italian stock are held in store by fate, glorious souls waiting to inherit our name, this shall I reveal in speech and inform you of your destiny . . .’ [Anchises points out to Aeneas the souls of great Roman kings and heroes yet to be born.] Thus they wander at large over the whole region in the wide airy plain, taking note of all . . .
     <br/>
     Two gates of Sleep there are [in Elysium] , whereof the one, they say, is horn and offers a ready exit to true shades, the other shining with the sheen of polished ivory, but delusive dreams issue upward through it from the world below. Thither Anchises, discoursing thus, escorts his son and with him the Sibylla, and sends them forth by the ivory gate : Aeneas speeds his way to the ships and rejoins his comrade."
