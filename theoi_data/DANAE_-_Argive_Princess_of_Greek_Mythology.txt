   DANAE - Argive Princess of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Danae was a princess of Argos in the Greek Peloponnese, the only child of King Acrisius. When her father learned a prophecy that he was destined to be killed by a son of his daughter, he locked Danae away in a subterranean, bronze chamber. Her prison, however, was infiltrated by the god Zeus who impregnated her in the guise of a golden shower. She conceived and bore a son named Perseus. As soon as her father learned of this, he placed Danae and the infant in a chest and set them adrift at sea. By the providence of the gods they made it safely to the island of Seriphos where the fisherman Dictys offered them refuge in his home." name="description"/>

     DANAE was a princess of Argos in the Greek Peloponnese, the only child of King Akrisios (Acrisius). When her father learned  a prophecy that he was destined to be killed by a son of his daughter, he locked Danae away in a subterranean, bronze chamber. Her prison, however, was  infiltrated by the god
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     who impregnated her in the guise of a golden shower. She conceived and bore a son named Perseus. As soon as her father learned of this, he placed Danae and the infant in a chest and set them adrift at sea. By the providence of the gods they  made it safely to the island of Seriphos where the fisherman Diktys (Dictys) offered them refuge in his home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later when Perseus was fully grown, King Polydektes  (Polydectes) of Seriphos sought Danae for his wife and, wishing to rid himself of her son, commanded Perseus fetch the
     <a href="../Pontios/Gorgones.html">
      Gorgon
     </a>
     's head. The hero returned victorious only to learn that his mother had fled to the temple of Athena seeking refuge from the king. In anger Perseus turned Polydektes and his allies to stone with Gorgon's head. He then travelled with mother to Argos to claim his grandfather's throne.
    </p>
    <p>
     Danae was the eponymous "queen" of the Danaans. Danaan was synonymous with Argive but was sometimes used to describe Greeks in general (e.g. in Homer's
     <em>
      Iliad
     </em>
     ).
    </p>
    <h3>
     CHRONOLOGY OF MYTH
    </h3>
    <p>
     In the chronology of myth Danae was a descendant of
     <a href="Io.html">
      Io
     </a>
     --an Argive maiden loved by Zeus who was forced to wander all the way to Egypt in the guise of a cow. 
  Io's great-great-grandson Danaus made the return trip to Argos with his fifty daughters, the Danaides, to claim the throne. Danae was a great-grandaughter of the Danaid Hypermnestra and her cousin Lynkeus.
     <br/>
     Of Danae's descendants, the most famous were Herakles, her great-great grandson, and King Eurystheus, her great-grandson
     <br/>
     It should be noted that the Argive genealogies were quite bloated and do not synchronise well with those of the other mythic royal houses.

     DANAE (Danaê). An oracle declared that Danaë, the daughter of Acrisius, would give birth to a son, who would kill his grandfather. For this reason Acrisius kept Danaë shut up in a subterraneous apartment, or in a brazen tower. But here she became mother of Perseus, notwithstanding the precautions of her father, according to some accounts by her uncle Proetus, and according to others by Zeus, who visited her in the form of a shower of gold. Acrisius ordered mother and child to be exposed on the wide sea in a chest; but the chest floated towards the island of Seriphus, where both were rescued by Dictys, the brother of king Polydectes. (Apollod. ii. 2. § 1, 4. § 1; Paus. ii. 16. § 2, 25. § 6, iii. 13. § 6; Hygin.
     <em>

     63.) According to a later or Italian tradition, the chest was carried to the coast of Italy, where king Pilumnus married Danaë, and founded Ardea (Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     vii. 410; Serv.
     <em>

     vii. 372); or Danaë is said to have come to Italy with two sons, Argus and Argeus, whom she had by Phineus, and took up her abode on the spot where Rome was afterwards built (Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     viii. 345). But, according to the common story, Polydectes, king of Seriphos, made Danae his slave, and courted her favour, but in vain; and in order to obtain the undisturbed possession of her, he sent off Perseus, who had in the meantime grown up to manhood, to the Gorgons, to fetch the head of Medusa, which he said he would give to Hippodameia as a wedding present (Tzetz.
     <em>

Why, I see that already the bride is eager to enjoy our love to the full. No wonder : she spent a long time wasting away all lonely in the ship beneath the foam.
