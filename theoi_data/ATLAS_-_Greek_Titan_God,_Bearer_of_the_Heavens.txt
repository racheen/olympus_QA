   ATLAS - Greek Titan God, Bearer of the Heavens
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Atlas was the Titan god who bore the sky aloft. He personified the quality of endurance. Atlas was a leader of the Titanes (Titans) in their war against Zeus and after their defeat he was condemned to carry the heavens upon his shoulders. According to others he was instead (or later) appointed guardian of the pillars which held the earth and sky asunder." name="description"/>

     ATLAS was the Titan god who bore the sky aloft. He personified the quality of endurance (
     <em>
      atlaô
     </em>
     ).
    </p>
    <p>
     Atlas was a leader of the Titanes (Titans) in their war against
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     and after their defeat he was condemned to carry the heavens upon his shoulders. According to others he was instead (or later) appointed guardian of the pillars which held the earth and sky asunder. Atlas was also the god who instructed mankind in the art of astronomy, a tool which was used by sailors in navigation and farmers in measuring the seasons. These roles were often combined and Atlas becomes the god who turns the heaven on their axis, causing the stars to revolve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Herakles (Heracles) encountered the Titan during his quest for the Golden Apples of the
     <a href="Hesperides.html">
      Hesperides
     </a>
     . He agreed to take the heavens upon his shoulders while Atlas fetched the apples. The hero also slew the
     <a href="../Ther/DrakonHesperios.html">
      Hesperian Drakon
     </a>
     (Hesperian Dragon), which in vase painting appears as the Titan's tormentor, and built two great pillars at the ends of the earth, perhaps to relieve the Titan of his labour.
    </p>
    <p>
     In a late myth, Atlas was transformed into the stony Atlas mountain by Perseus using the
     <a href="../Pontios/Gorgones.html">
      Gorgon
     </a>
     's head. The Titan was also the
     <a href="../greek-mythology/star-myths.html">
      constellation
     </a>
     Kneeler.

    <p>
     ATLAS (Atlas), according to Hesiod (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     507, &amp;c.), a son of Japetus and Clymene, and a brother of Menoetius, Prometheus, and Epimetheus; according to Apollodorus (i. 2. § 3), his mother's name was Asia; and, according to Hyginus (
     <em>
      Fab. Praef.
     </em>
     ), he was a son of Aether and Gaea. For other accounts see Diod. iii. 60, iv. 27; Plat.
     <em>
      Critias,
     </em>
     p. 114; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 247. According to the description of the Homeric poems, Atlas knows the depth of all the sea, and bears the long columns which keep asunder, or carry all around (amphis echousi), earth and heaven. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     i. 52.) Hesiod only says, that he bore heaven with his head and hands. (Comp. Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Prom.
     </em>
     347, &amp;c.; Paus. v. 18. § 1, 11. § 2.) In these passages Atlas is described either as bearing heaven alone, or as bearing both heaven and earth; and several modern scholars have been engaged in investigating which of the two notions was the original one. Much depends upon the meaning of the Homeric expression amphis echousi; if the signification is "the columns which keep asunder heaven and earth," the columns (mountains) must be conceived as being somewhere in the middle of the earth's surface; but if they mean "bear or support all around," they must be regarded as forming the circumference of the earth, upon which the vault of heaven rests
     <em>
      apparently.
     </em>
     In either case, the meaning of keeping asunder is implied. In the Homeric description of Atlas, the idea of his being a superhuman or divine being, with a personal existence, seems to be blended with the idea of a mountain. The idea of heaven-bearing Atlas is, according to Letronne, a mere personification of a cosmographic notion, which arose from the views entertained by the ancients respecting the nature of heaven and its relation to the earth; and such a personification, when once established, was further developed and easily connected with other myths, such as that of the Titans. Thus Atlas is described as the leader of the Titans in their contest with Zeus, and, being conquered, he was condemned to the labour of bearing heaven on his head and hands. (Hesiod,
     <em>
      l c.;
     </em>
     Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     150.) Still later traditions distort the original idea still more, by putting rationalistic interpretations upon it, and make Atlas a man who was metamorphosed into a mountain. Thus Ovid (
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     iv. 630,&amp;c., comp. ii. 296) relates, that Perseus came to him and asked for shelter, which he was refused, whereupon Perseus, by means of the head of Medusa, changed him into mount Atlas, on which rested heaven with all its stars. Others go still further, and represent Atlas as a powerful king, who possessed great knowledge of the courses of the stars, and who was the first who taught men that heaven had the form of a globe. Hence the expression that heaven rested on his shoulders was regarded as a mere figurative mode of speaking. (Diod. iii. 60, iv. 27; Paus. ix. 20. § 3; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     i. 745; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycophr.
     </em>
     873.) At first, the story of Atlas referred to one mountain only, which was believed to exist on the extreme boundary of the earth; but, as geographical knowledge extended, the name of Atlas was transferred to other places, and thus we read of a Mauritanian, Italian, Arcadian, and even of a Caucasian, Atlas. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 1 ; Dionys. i. 61; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     viii. 134.) The common opinion, however, was, that the heaven-bearing Atlas was in the north-western part of Africa, and the range of mountains in that part of the world bears the name of Atlas down to this day. Atlas is said to have been the father of the Pleiades by Pleione or by Hesperis, of the Hyades and Hesperides by Aethra, and of Oenomaus and Maea by Sterope. (Apollod. iii. 10. § 1; Diod. iv. 27; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     viii. 130.) Dione and Calypso, and Hyas and Hesperus, are likewise called his children. (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     vii. 245; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     83.) Atlas was painted by Panaenus on the parapet surrounding the statue of the Olympian Zeus (Paus. v. 11. § 2); on the chest of Cypselus he was seen carrying heaven and holding in his hands the golden apples of the Hesperides; and on the throne of Apollo at Amyclae he was likewise represented. (Paus. v. 18. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.)

     Herakles (Heracles) sought the assistance of Atlas in his quest to recover the Apples of the Hesperides. He slew the Drakon which tormented the Titan and took upon himself the weight of the heavens, while Atlas recovered the apples for him.

     "Prometheus advised Herakles (Heracles) not to go after the apples himself, but rather to reelive Atlas of the celestial sphere and dispatch him. So when Herakles reached Atlas among the Hyperboreans, he remembered Prometheus' advise and took over the sphere. Atlas picked three apples from the garden of the Hesperides, then returned to Herakles. Not wanting to hold up the sphere, he told Herakles that he should carry the applies back to Eurystheus, and that Herakles could hold up the sky in his place. Herakles agreed, but by a trick gave the sphere back to Atlas. On the advise of Prometheus he asked Atlas to take the sky while he put a cushion on his head. Hearing this, Atlas set the apples down on the ground, and relieved Herakles of the sphere. Thus Herakles picked them up and left. Some say, however, that he did not take the apples from Atlas, but killed the Drakon (Dragon) that guarded them, and picked them himself. Returning with the apples he gave them to Eurystheus who made a present of them to Herakles. But Athene (Athena) retrieved them from him and took them back, for it was not permitted by diving law to locate them anywhere else."

     "[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Atlas. With Atlas also did Herakles (Heracles) contend, and that too without a command from Eurystheus, claiming that he could sustain the heavens better than Atlas. For he saw that Atlas was bowed over and crushed by the weight and that he was crouching on one knee alone and barely had strength left to stand, while as for himself, he averred that he could raise the heavens up and after setting them aloft could hold them for a long time. Of course he does not reveal this ambition at all, but merely says that he is sorry for Atlas on account of his labour and would willingly share his burden with him. And Atlas has so gladly seized upon the offer of Herakles that he implores him to venture the task.
     <br/>
     Atlas is represented as exhausted, to judge by all the sweat that trickles from him and to infer from his trembling arm, but Herakles earnestly desires the task. This is shown by the eager look on his face, the club thrown on the ground and the hands that beg for the task. There is no need to admire the shaded parts of Herakles' body because they are vigorously drawn--for the attitudes of recumbent figures or persons standing erect are easily shaded, and their accurate reproduction is not at all a mark of skill--but the shadows on Atlas show a high degree of skill; for the shadows on a crouching figure like his run into one another, and do not darken any of the projecting parts but they produce light on the parts that are hollow and retreating. The belly of Atlas, for instance, one can see although he is bending forward, and one can perceive that he is panting. The bodies in the heavens which he carries are painted in the ether that surrounds the stars; one can recognize a bull, that is the Bull of the heavens [i.e. Taurus], and bears, the kind that are seen here. Of the winds some are represented facing in the same direction and others as facing in the opposite direction, and while some are friendly with each other others seem to keep up their strife in the heavens.

     You will uphold these heavenly bodies for the present, Herakles; but before long you will live with them in the sky, drinking, and embracing the beautiful Hebe."

I ask for rest and lodging.’ But the giant recalled the oracle which Themis Parnasia had given : ‘Atlas, a time shall come when from your tree the gold shall be despoiled, and of that spoil a son of Jove shall boast.’ In fear he had walled his orchards all around with massive ramparts and for guardian set an enormous Draco; and drove off all strangers from the borders of his realm.

     "[The writer Diodorus Siculus presents a rationalised interpretation of the Atlas myth :] But we must not fail to mention what the myths relate about Atlas and about the race of the Hesperides. The account runs like this: In the country known as Hesperitis there were two brothers whose fame was known abroad, Hesperos (Hesperus) and Atlas. These brothers possessed flocks of sheep which excelled in beauty and were in colour of a golden yellow, this being the reason why the poets, in speaking of these sheep as
     <em>
      mela
     </em>
     , called them golden
     <em>
      mela
     </em>
     . Now Hesperos begat a daughter named Hesperis, who he gave in marriage to his brother and after whom the land was given the name Hesperitis; and Atlas begat by her seven daughters, who were named after their father Atlantides, and after their mother Hesperides. And since these Atlantides excelled in beauty and chastity, Busiris the king of the Aigyptians (Egyptians), the account says, was seized with a desire to get the maidens into his power; and consequently he dispatched pirates by sea with orders to seize the girls and deliver them into his hands . . . 
  [Herakles (Heracles) slew Busiris.]
     <br/>
     Meanwhile the pirates had seized the girls while they were playing in a certain garden and carried them off, and fleeing swiftly to their ships had sailed away with them. Herakles came upon the pirates as they were taking their meal on a certain strand, and learning from the maidens what had taken place he slew the pirates to a man and brought the girls back to Atlas their father; and in return Atlas was so grateful to Herakles for his kindly deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for, but he also instructed him quite freely in the knowledge of astrology. For Atlas had worked out the science of astrology to a degree surpassing others and had ingeniously discovered the spherical arrangement of the stars, and for that reason was generally believed to be bearing the entire firmament upon his shoulders. Similarly in the case of Herakles, when he had brought to the Greeks the doctrine of the sphere, he gained great fame, as if he had taken over the burden of the firmament which Atlas had borne, since men intimated in this enigmatic way what had actually taken place."
