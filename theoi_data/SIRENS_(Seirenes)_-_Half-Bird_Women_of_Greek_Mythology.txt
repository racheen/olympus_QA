   SIRENS (Seirenes) - Half-Bird Women of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology the Sirens were three monstrous sea-nymphs who lured sailors to their death with a bewitching song. They were formerly handmaidens of the goddess Persephone and when she was secretly abducted by Haides, Demeter gave them the bodies of birds to assist in the search. They eventually gave up and settled on the flowery island of Anthemoessa. The Sirens were depicted as birds with either the heads or entire upper bodies of women." name="description"/>

     THE SEIRENES (Sirens) were three monstrous sea-nymphs who lured sailors to their death with a bewitching song. They were formerly handmaidens of the goddess
     <a href="../Khthonios/Persephone.html">
      Persephone
     </a>
     and when she was secretly abducted by
     <a href="../Khthonios/Haides.html">
      Haides
     </a>
     ,
     <a href="../Olympios/Demeter.html">
      Demeter
     </a>
     gave them the bodies of birds  to assist in the search. They eventually gave up and settled on the flowery island of Anthemoessa.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Seirenes were encountered by the Argonauts who passed by unharmed with the help of the poet Orpheus who drowned out their music with song. 
  Odysseus later sailed by, bound tightly to the mast, while his men blocked their ears with wax. The Seirenes were so distressed to see a man hear their song and still escape that they threw themselves into the sea and drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Seirenes were depicted as birds with either the heads or entire upper bodies of women. In mosaic art they were depicted with just bird legs.

When Odysseus, in his wanderings through the Mediterranean, came near the island on the lovely beach of which the Sirens were sitting, and endeavouring to allure him and his companions, he, on the advice of Circe, stuffed the ears of his companions with wax, and tied himself to the mast of his vessel, until he was so far off that he could no longer hear their song (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 39, &amp;c., 166, &amp;c.). According to Homer, the island of the Sirens was situated between Aeaea and the rock of Scylla, near the south-western coast of Italy. Homer says nothing of their number, but later writers mention both their names and number some state that they were two, Aglaopheme and Thelxiepeia (Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1709); and others, that there were three, Peisinoë, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph. 712
     </em>
     ), or Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia (Eustath.
     <em>
      l. c. ;
     </em>
     Strab. v. pp. 246, 252; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Georg.
     </em>
     iv. 562). They are called daughters of Phorcus (Plut.
     <em>
      Sympos.
     </em>
     ix. 14), of Achelous and Sterope (Apollod. i. 7. § 10), of Terpsichore (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 893), of Melpomene (Apollod. i. 3. § 4), of Calliope (Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     v. 364), or of Gaea (Eurip.
     <em>
      Hel. 168
     </em>
     ). Their place of abode is likewise different in the different traditions, for some place them on cape Pelorum others in the island of Anthemusa, and others again in the Sirenusian islands near Paestum, or in Capreae (Strab. i. p. 22; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1709; Serv.
     <em>
      l.c.
     </em>
     ). The Sirens are also connected with the legends about the Argonauts and the rape of Persephone. When the Argonauts, it is said. passed by the Sirens, the latter began to sing, but in vain, for Orpheus rivalled and surpassed them ; and as it had been decreed that they should live only till some one hearing their song should pass by unmoved, they threw themselves into the sea, and were metamorphosed into rocks. Some writers connected the self-destruction of the Sirens with the story of Orpheus and the Argonauts, and others With that of Odysseus (Strab. v. p. 252; Orph.
     <em>
      Arg.
     </em>
     1284; Apollod. i. 9. § 25; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab. 141
     </em>
     ). Late poets represent them as provided with wings, which they are said to have received at their own request, in order to be able to search after Persephone (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     v. 552), or as a punishment from Demeter for not having assisted Persephone (Hygin.
     <em>
      l. c.
     </em>
     ), or from Aphrodite, because they wished to remain virgins (Eustath.
     <em>
      l. c. ;
     </em>
     Aelian,
     <em>
      H. A.
     </em>
     xvii. 23; Apollon. Rhod. iv. 896). Once, however, they allowed themselves to be prevailed upon by Hera to enter into a contest with the Muses, and being defeated, they were deprived of their wings (Paus. ix. 34. § 2; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 85). There was a temple of the Sirens near Surrentum, and the tomb of Parthenope was believed to be near Neapolis. (Strab. i. p. 23, v. p. 246.)
     <br/>
     Achelo′is. A surname of the Sirens, the daughters of Achelous and a muse. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     v. 552, xiv. 87; Apollod. i. 7. § 10.)
     <br/>
     Ligeia or Ligea (Ligeia), (Ligeia), i. e. the shrill sounding, occurs as the name of a seiren and of a nymph. (Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1709; Virg.
     <em>
      Georg.
     </em>
     iv. 336.)
     <br/>
     Parthe′nope (Parthenopê). One of the Seirens (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Hom. Od.
     </em>
     xii. 39; Aristot.
     <em>
      Mir. Ausc.
     </em>
     103.) At Naples her tomb was shown, and a torch race was held every year in her honour. (Strab. v. p. 246; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     732.)

     "Before long they [the Argonauts] sighted the beautiful island of Anthemoessa, where the clear-voiced Seirenes (Sirens), Akheloios' (Achelous') daughters, used to bewitch with their seductive melodies whatever sailors anchored there. Lovely Terpsikhore (Terpsichore), one of the Mousai (Muses), has borne them to Akheloios, and at one time they had been handmaids to Demeter’s gallant Daughter [Persephone], before she was married, and sung to her in chorus. But now, half human and half bird in form, they spent their time watching for ships from a height that overlooked their excellent harbour; and many a traveller, reduced by them to skin and bones, had forfeited the happiness of reaching home. The Seirenes, hoping to add the Argonauts to these, made haste to greet them with a liquid melody; and the young men would soon have cast their hawsers on the beach if Thrakian Orpheos (Orpheus) had not intervened. Raising his Bistonian lyre, he drew from it the lively tune of a fast-moving song, so as to din their ears with a medley of competing sounds. The girlish voices were defeated by the lure; and the set wind, aided by the sounding backwash from the shore, carried the ship off. The Seirenes’ song grew indistinct; yet even so there was one man, Boutes the noble son of Teleon, who was so enchanted by their sweet voices that before he could be stopped he leapt into the sea from his polished bench. The poor man swam through the dark swell making for the shore, and had he landed, they would soon have robbed him of all hope of reaching home. But Aphrodite, Queen of Eryx, had pity on him. She snatched him up while he was still battling with the surf; and having saved his life, she took him to her heart and found a home for him on the heights of Lilybaion."

     "[Kirke (Circe) warns Odysseus of the dangers of the journey ahead :] ‘You will come to the Seirenes (Sirens) first of all; they bewitch any mortal who approaches them. If a man in ignorance draws too close and catches their music, he will never return to fine wife and little children near him and to see their joy at his homecoming; the high clear tones of the Seirenes will bewitch him. They sit in a meadow; men's corpses lie heaped up all round them, mouldering upon the bones as the skin decays. You must row past there; you must stop the ears of all your crew with sweet wax that you have kneaded, so that none of the rest may hear the song. But if you yourself are bent on hearing, then give them orders to bind you both hand and foot as you stand upright against the mast-stay, with the rope-ends tied to the mast itself; thus you may hear the two Seirenes' voices and be enraptured. If you implore your crew and beg them to release you, then they must bind you fast with more bonds again. 
  When your crew have rowed past the Seirenes . . . [you reach the Wandering Rocks and the straight of Skylla (Scylla) and Kharybdis (Charybdis)].’"
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-greek">
      Homer, Odyssey 12. 200 ff :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "Then with heavy heart I [Odysseus] spoke to my comrades thus : ‘Friends it is not right that only one man, or only two, should know the divine decrees that Lady Kirke (Circe) has uttered to me. I will tell you of them, so that in full knowledge we may die or in full knowledge escape, it may be, from death and doom. Her first command was to shun the Seirenes (Sirens)--their enchanting notes, their flowery meadow. I alone was to hear their song, she said. You for your part must bind me with galling ropes as I stand upright against the mast-stay, with the rope-ends tied to the mast itself; then I shall stay there immovably. And if I beg and beseech you to set me free, you must bind me hard with more ropes again.’
     <br/>
     Thus I told my comrades and made things plain, point by point. Meanwhile the trim ship sped swiftly on to the island of the Seirenes, wafted still be the favouring breeze. Then of a sudden the wind dropped and everything became hushed and still, because some divinity lulled the waters. My men stood up, furled the sails and stowed them in the ship's hold, then sat at the thwarts and made the sea white with their polished oars of fir. I myself, with my sharp sword, cut a great round of wax into little pieces and set about kneading them with all the strength I had. Under my mighty hands, and under the beams of the lordly sun-god [Helios] whose father is Hyperion, the wax quickly began to melt, and with it I sealed all my comrades' ears in turn. Then they bound me fast, hand and foot, with the rope-ends tied to the mast itself, then again sat down and dipped their oars in the whitening sea.
     <br/>
     But them, the Seirenes (Sirens) saw the quick vessel near them and raised their voices in high clear notes : ‘Come hither, renowned Odysseus, hither, you pride and glory of all Akhaia (Achaea)! Pause with your ship; listen to our song. Never has nay man passed this way in his dark vessel and left unheard the honey-sweet music from our lips; first he has taken his delight, then gone on his way a wiser man. We know of all the sorrows in the wide land of Troy that Argives and Trojans bore because the gods would needs have it so; we know all things that come to pass on the fruitful earth.’
     <br/>
     So they sang with their lovely voices, and my heart was eager to listen still. I twitched my brows to sign to the crew to let me go, but they leaned to their oars and rowed on; Eurylokhos (Eurylochus) and Perimedes quickly stood up and bound me with more ropes and with firmer hold. But when they had rowed well past the Seirenes--when music and words could be heard no more--my trusty comrades were quick to take out the wax that had sealed their ears, and to rescue and unbind myself. 
  But the island was hardly left behind when I saw smoke above the heavy breakers and heard a great noise [the whirlpool of Kharybdis (Charybdis)]."
