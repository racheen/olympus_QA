   ENDYMION - Elean Shepherd-Prince of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Endymion was a handsome shepherd-prince loved by the moon-goddess Selene. When Zeus offered him his choice of destinies, Endymion chose immortality and youth in eternal slumber. He was laid out in a cave on Mount Latmus in Caria where his lunar lover would visit him each night. In another myth--which contradicts the first--Endymion was a king of Elis in the Greek Peloponesse who founded the kingdom with a group of Aeolian colonists from Thessaly." name="description"/>

    <p>
     ENDYMION was a handsome shepherd-prince loved by the moon-goddess
     <a href="../Titan/Selene.html">
      Selene
     </a>
     . When
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     offered him his choice of destinies, Endymion chose  immortality and youth in eternal slumber. He was laid out in a cave on Mount Latmus in Karia (Caria) where his lunar lover would visit him each night.
    </p>
    <p>
     In another myth--which contradicts the first--Endymion was a king of Elis in the Greek Peloponesse who founded the kingdom with a group of Aiolian (Aeolian) colonists from Thessalia (Thessaly). Zeus granted him foreknowledge of his own death and, when his time had come, he set up a racecourse at Olympia and commanded his  sons compete for the throne.  Endymion was  afterwards entombed beside the starting gate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Eleian myths about King Endymion belong  to the Greek tradition. The stories of the sleeping prince of Mount Latmos  in Anatolia, on the other hand, were apparently a Greek translation of  stories concerning the indigenous Karian moon-god Men--the Karians were a non-Greek people native to that region of Asia Minor. As the Greek moon-deity was female, the story was amended somewhat.
    </p>
    <h3>
     THE HEIRS OF THE ELEIAN ENDYMION
    </h3>
    <p>
     Of the three Eleian sons of Endymion, Epeios (Epeus) won the race for the throne and was crowned king of Elis. The second son Paion (Paeon) departed with colonists and settled the region of Paionia, north of Mount Olympos. The third son Aitolos (Aetolus) was exiled for the murder of Apis and established the kingdom of Aitolia  (Aetolia) on the opposite side of the Gulf of Korinthos.
     <br/>
     During the reign of King Epeios, the Lydian immigrant Pelops seized control of Pisa and came to dominate most of the Peloponessos. Epeios passed away childless and left the throne to his adoptive son and nephew Eleios (Eleus)--son of Endymion's daughter Eurykyda (Eurycyda) by the god Poseidon. This man in turn fathered Augeias (Augeas), the famous Eleian king who cheated Herakles out of his reward for cleaning the stables. Two of Augeias'  grandchildren  eventually went on to lead troops from Elis and the neighbouring island of Doulichion (now Zacynthus) to the Trojan War.
    </p>
    <h3>
     CHRONOLOGY OF MYTH
    </h3>
    <p>
     In the chronology of myth, Endymion was a contemporary of
     <a href="Salmoneus.html">
      Salmoneus
     </a>
     , Sisyphos and the other sons of Aiolos (Aeolus)--who were, in fact, his uncles. When the family colonised the Peloponessos, Endymion settled the lands north of the river Alpheios, and Salmoneus the lands south.
     <br/>
     Endymion was a great-grandson of
     <a href="Deukalion.html">
      Deukalion (Deucalion)
     </a>
     , survivor of the Great Deluge. His father was Aithlios, probably the eponymous king of the Thessalian Aithikes, a tribe of the Pindar mountain range.
     <br/>
     His grandson
     <a href="Augeas.html">
      Augeias
     </a>
     ruled Elis in the time of Herakles, while his descendants--mostly great-great grandchildren--led the troops of Elis, Doulikhion, Aitolia, and Argos in the Trojan War. The most famous of these was Diomedes, a direct patrilineal descendant.

     ENDYMION (Endumiôn), a youth distinguished for his beauty, and renowned in ancient story by the perpetual sleep in which he spent his life. Some traditions about Endymion refer us to Elis, and others to Caria, and others again are a combination of the two. According to the first set of legends, he was a son of Aëthlius and Calyce, or of Zeus and Calyce, and succeeded Aëthlius in the kingdom of Elis. (Paus. v. 1. § 2.) Others again say that he expelled Clymenus from the kingdom of Elis, and introduced into the country Aeolian settlers from Thessaly. (Apollod. i. 7. § 5, &amp;c. ; Paus. v. 8. § 1.) Conon (
     <em>
      Narrat
     </em>
     14) calls him a son of Zeus and Protogeneia, and Hyginus (
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     271) a son of Aetolus. He is said to have been married to Asterodia, Chromia, Hyperippe, Neïs, or Iphianassa; and Aetolus, Paeon, Epeius. Eurydice, and Naxus are called his children. He was, however, especially beloved by Selene, by whom he had fifty daughters. (Paus. v. 1. § 2.) He caused his sons to engage in the race-course at Olympia, and promised to the victor the succession in his kingdom, and Epeius conquered his brothers, and succeeded Endymion as king of Elis. He was believed to be buried at Olympia, which also contained a statue of his in the treasury of the Metapontians. (Paus. vi. 19. § 8, 20. § 6.) According to a tradition, believed at Heracleia in Caria, Endymion had come from Elis to mount Latmus in Caria, whence he is called the Latmian (
     <em>
      Latmius
     </em>
     ; Paus. v. 1. § 4; Ov.
     <em>
      Ars Am.
     </em>
     iii. 83,
     <em>
      Trist.
     </em>
     ii. 299). He is described by the poets either as a king, a shepherd, or a hunter (Theocrit. iii. 49, xx. 37 with the Scholiast), and while he was slumbering in a cave of mount Latmus, Selene came down to him, kissed, and lay by his side. (Comp. Apollon. Rhod. iv. 57.) There also he had, in later times, a sanctuary, and his tomb was shown in a cave of mount Latmus. (Paus. v. 1. § 4 ; Strab. xiv. p. 636.) His eternal sleep on Latmus is assigned to different causes in ancient story. Some said that Zeus had granted him a request, and that Endymion begged for immortality, eternal sleep, and everlasting youth (Apollod. i. 7. § 5.); others relate that he was received among the gods of Olympus, but as he there fell in love with Hera, Zeus, in his anger, punished him by throwing him into eternal sleep on mount Latmus. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit.
     </em>
     iii. 49.) Others, lastly, state that Selene, charmed with his surpassing beauty, sent him to sleep, that she might be able to kiss him without being observed by him. (Cic.
     <em>
      Tuscal.
     </em>
     i. 38.) The stories of the fair sleeper, Endymion, the darling of Selene, are unquestionably poetical fictions, in which sleep is personified. His name and all his attributes confirm this opinion : Endymion signifies a being that gently comes over one ; he is called a king, because he has power over all living creatures; a shepherd, because he slumbered in the cool caves of mount Latmus, that is, "the mount of oblivion." Nothing can be more beautiful, lastly, than the notion, that he is kissed by the soft rays of the moon. (Comp. Plat.
     <em>
      Phaed.
     </em>
     p. 72. b; Ov.
     <em>
      Am.
     </em>
     i. 13. 43.) There is a beautiful statue of a sleeping Endymion in the British Museum.

At a slight distance away from it, after one has crossed a little river near Latmos, there is to be seen the sepulchre of Endymion, in a cave."

And he cites as evidence of all this two inscriptions, the one at Therma in Aitolia (where it is their ancestral custom to hold their elections of magistrates), engraved on the base of the statue of Aitolos :--‘Founder of the country, once reared beside the eddies of the Alpheios (Alpheus), neighbor of the race-courses of Olympia, son of Endymion, this Aitolos has been set up by the Aitolians as a memorial of his valor to behold.’ . . . When Aitolos arrived from Elis and overpowered the Kouretes in war, they withdrew into Akarnania . . . And this is evidenced also by the inscription among the Eleians, for Aitolos, it says, ‘through many a toil with the spear took possession of the land of Kouretis.’" [N.B. The Kouretes were an AItolian tribe, not to be confused with the protectors of the infant Zeus.]

      Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 1. 3 - 9 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "The Eleians we know crossed over from Kalydon (Calydon) and Aitolia (Aetolia) generally. Their earlier history I found to be as follows. The first to rule in this land, they say, was Aethlios (Aethlius), who was the son of Zeus and of Protogeneia, the daughter of Deukalion (Deucalion), and the father of Endymion.
     <br/>
     Selene (the Moon), they say, fell in love with this Endymion and bore him fifty daughters. Others with greater probability say that Endymion took a wife Asterodia--others say she was Khromia (Chromia), the daughter of Itonos (Itonus), the son of Amphiktyon; others again, Hyperippe, the daughter of Arkas (Arcas)--but all agree that Endymion begat Paion (Paeon), Epeios (Epeus), Aitolos (Aetolus), and also a daughter Eurykyda (Eurycyda). Endymion set his sons to run a race at Olympia for the throne; Epeios won, and obtained the kingdom, and his subjects were then named Epeians for the first time.
     <br/>
     Of his brothers they say that Aitolos remained at home, while Paion, vexed at his defeat, went into the farthest exile possible, and that the region beyond the river Axios was named after him Paionia (Paeonia). As to the death of Endymion, the people of Herakleia (Heraclea) near Miletos do not agree with the Eleians for while the Eleians show a tomb of Endymion, the folk of Herakleia say that he retired to Mount Latmos (Latmus) and give him honor, there being a shrine of Endymion on Latmos.
     <br/>
     Epeios married Anaxiroe, the daughter of Koronos (Coronus), and begat a daughter Hyrmina, but no male issue. In the reign of Epeios the following events also occurred. Oinomaos (Oenomaus) was the son of Alxion  . . . but while lord of the land of Pisa he was put down by Pelops the Lydian, who crossed over from Asia. On the death of Oinomaos, Pelops took possession of the land of Pisa and its bordering country Olympia, separating it from the land of Epeios . . .
     <br/>
     Aitolos, who came to the throne after Epeios, was made to flee from Peloponnesos, because the children of Apis tried and convicted him of unintentional homicide. For Apis, the son of Jason, from Pallantion in Arkadia, was run over and killed by the chariot of Aitolos at the games held in honor of Azan. Aitolos, son of Endymion, gave to the dwellers around the Akheloios (Achelous) their name, when he fled to this part of the mainland.
     <br/>
     But the kingdom of the Epeians fell to Eleios, the son of Eurykyda, daughter of Endymion and, believe the tale who will, of Poseidon. It was Eleios who gave the inhabitants their present name of Eleians in place of Epeians. 
  Eleios had a son Augeas. Those who exaggerate his glory give a turn to the name Eleios and make Helios (the Sun) to be the father of Augeas."

When the sons of Pelops were scattered from Elis over all the rest of Peloponnesos, Amythaon, the son of Kretheus (Cretheus), and cousin of Endymion on his father's side--for they say that Aethlios too was the son of Aiolos (Aeolus), though supposed to be a son of Zeus--, held the Olympian games."

     <em>

     KINGDOMS
     <br/>
     1. Pisa (southern Elis); 2. Elis (central Elis); 3. Bouprasion (northern Elis); 4. Doulikhion (island west of Elis); 5. Olenos (northern Elis &amp; western Akhaia).
     <br/>
     NOTES
     <br/>
     * Eleios-Heleios is the same figure. One tradition represents him as a son of Perseus and the heir of King Pelops, another makes him a grandson of King Endymion. He was sometimes confounded with the sun-god Helios.
     <br/>
     ** Augeias ruled the whole of Elis including the regions of Elis, Pisa, Bouprasion and Doulikhion. After his death the kingdom was divided into four autonomous parts.
     <br/>
     *** Amarynkeus received a quarter of the kingdom of Augeias. One assumes his portion was Pisatis.
     <br/>
     **** In the reign of Hipponoos, Olenos was annexed by King Oineus of Aitolia. It is listed as an Aitolian dominion in Homer's
     <em>
      Catalogue of Ships
     </em>
     .
