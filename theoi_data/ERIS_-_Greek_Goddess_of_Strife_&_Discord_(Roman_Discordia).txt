    <p>
     ERIS was the goddess or personified spirit (
     <em>
      daimona
     </em>
     ) of strife, discord, contention and rivalry. She was often portrayed, more specifically, as the
     <em>
      daimona
     </em>
     of the strife of war, haunting the battlefield and delighting in human bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because of Eris' disagreeable nature she was the only goddess not to be invited to the wedding of Peleus and
     <a href="../Pontios/NereisThetis.html">
      Thetis
     </a>
     . When she turned up anyway and was refused admittance, she raged and threw a golden apple amongst the goddesses inscribed "To the fairest." Three laid claim to it--Hera, Aphrodite and Athena--and in their rivalry brought about the events leading up to the Trojan War.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eris was closely identified with the war-goddess
     <a href="Enyo.html">
      Enyo
     </a>
     . Homer uses the names interchangeably. Her Roman name was Discordia.

     ERIS (Eris), the goddess who calls forth war and discord. According to the Iliad, she wanders about, at first small and insignificant, but she soon raises her head up to heaven (iv. 441). She is the friend and sister of Ares, and with him she delights in the tumult of war, increasing the moaning of men. (iv. 445, v. 518, xx. 48.) She is insatiable in her desire for bloodshed, and after all the other gods have withdrawn from the battle-field, she still remains rejoicing over the havoc that has been made. (v. 518, xi. 3, &amp;c., 73.) According to Hesiod (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     225, &amp;c.), she was a daughter of Night, and the poet describes her as the mother of a variety of allegorical beings, which are the causes or representatives of man's misfortunes. It was Eris who threw the apple into the assembly of the gods, the cause of so much suffering and war. Virgil introduces Discordia as a being similar to the Homeric Eris; for Discordia appears in company with Mars, Bellona, and the Furies, and Virgil is evidently imitating Homer. (

     "For ere this [the opening of Pandora's jar] the tribes of men lived on earth remote and free from ills (
     <em>
      kakoi
     </em>
     ) and hard toil (
     <em>

     ) which bring the Keres (Death-Demons) upon men; for in misery men grow old quickly. But the woman [Pandora] took off the great lid of the jar with her hands and scattered all these [presumably  the daimon-spawn of Eris] and her thought caused sorrow and mischief to men. Only Elpis (Hope) remained there in an unbreakable home within under the rim of the great jar, and did not fly out at the door; for ere that, the lid of the jar stopped her, by the will of Aegis-holding Zeus who gathers the clouds. But the rest, countless plagues (
     <em>
      muria lugra
     </em>
     ), wander amongst men; for earth is full of evils (
     <em>
      kakoi

     ) and the sea is full. Of themselves diseases (
     <em>
      nosoi

     [N.B. 
  The word Lugra (Banes) used above to describe the Daimones released from the jar of Pandora, is found in the works of Homer and other poets in combination with   terms such as
     <em>
      algea
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      androktasie

     and
     <em>

     . Most of these Lugra (Banes) are personified as children of Eris in Hesiod's Theogony. Clearly the poet imagines these as the Daimones of the jar.

     "[The wedding of Peleus and Thetis :] And all the race of gods hasted to do honour to the white-armed bride [Thetis] . . . But Eris (Strife) [alone] did Kheiron (Chiron) [who sent out the invitations] leave unhonoured: Kheiron did not regard her and Peleus heeded her not . . . And Eris (Strife) overcome by the pangs of angry jealousy, wandered in search of a way to disturb the banquet of the gods. And often would she leap up from her chair, set with precious stones, and anon sit down again. She smote her hand the bosom of the earth and heeded not the rock. Fain would she unbar the bolts of the darksome hollows and rouse the Titanes (Titans) from the nether pit and destroy heaven the seat of Zeus, who rules on high. Fain would she brandish the roaring thunderbolt of fire, yet gave way, for all her rage, to Hephaistos (Hephaestus), keeper of quenchless fire and of iron. And she thought to rouse the heavy-clashing din of shields, if haply they might leap up in terror at the noise. But from her later crafty counsel, too, she withdrew in fear of iron Ares, the shielded warrior.
     <br/>
     And now she bethought her of the golden apples of the Hesperides. Thence Eris took the fruit that should be the harbinger of war, even the apple, and devised the scheme of signal woes. Whirling her arm she hurled into the banquet the primal seed of turmoil and disturbed the choir of goddesses. Hera, glorying to be the spouse and to share the bed of Zeus, rose up amazed, and would fain have seized it. And Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], as being more excellent than all, desired to have the apple, for that it is the treasure of the Erotes (Loves). But Hera would not give it up and Athena would not yield. And Zeus, seeing the quarrel of the goddesses, and calling his son Hermaon [Hermes], who sat below his throne, addressed him thus : ‘If haply, my son, thou hast heard of a son of Priamos (Priam), one Paris, the splendid youth, who tends his herds on this hills of Troy, give to him the apple; and bid him judge the goddesses' meeting brows and orbed eyes. And let her that is preferred have the famous fruit to carry away as the prize of the fairer and ornament of the Loves.’
     <br/>
     So the father, the son of Kronos (Cronus), commanded Hermaon. And he hearkened to the bidding of his father and led the goddesses upon the way and failed not to heed . . .
     <br/>
     [Paris received the goddesses and awarded the apple to Aphrodite who had bribed him by offering the most beautiful woman in the world--Helene (Helen)--as his bride. With Aphrodite's aid Paris seduced queen Helene and abducted her to Troy, the spark that preempted the Trojan War]."

Phobos (Rout) drove the team of this dreamchariot, in the counterfeit shape of Attis with limbs like his; he formed the image of Kybele's (Cybele's) [the mentor of Dionysos] charioteer, a softskinned man in looks with shrill tones like the voice of a woman. Gadabout Eris stood by the head of sleeping Bakkhos and reproached him with brawl-inciting voice : 
  ‘You sleep, godborn Dionysos! Deriades [the Indian King] summons you to battle, and you make merry here! Stepmother Hera mocks you, when she sees your Enyo on the run, as you drag your army to dances! I am ashamed to show myself before Kronion, I shrink form Hera, I shrink from the immortals, because your doings are not worthy of Rheia. I avoid Ares, destroyer of the Titanes (Titans) . . . and I fear your sister still more . . . flashhelm Pallas, because Athena too blames Bakkhos idle, the woman blames the man! Thyrsos yielded to goatskin, since once upon a time valiant Pallas holding the goatskin defended the gates of Olympos, and scattered the stormy assault of the Titanes, thus honouring the dexterous travail of her father's head--but you disgrace the fruitful pocket in Zeus's thigh! . . . The Virgin Archeress [Artemis] denounces Dionysos the dancer . . . I shrink from Leto, still a proud braggart, when she holds up at me the arrow that defended her bed and slew Tityos (Tityus) the lustful giant. I am tortured also with double pain, when I see sorrowing Semele and proud Maia among the stars. You are not like a son of Zeus. You did not slay with an arrow threatening Otos (Otus) and hightowering Ephialtes, no winged shaft of your destroyed Tityos, you did not kill that unhappy lover bold Orion, nor Hera's guardian Argos, the cowkeeper, a son of the earth so fertile in evil, the spy on Zeus in his weddings with horned cattle! No, you weave your web of merriment with Stayphylos and Botrys, inglorious, unarmed, singing songs over the wine; you degrade the earthy generation of Satyroi (Satyrs), sine they also have touched the bloodless Bakkhanal (Bacchanal) dance and drowned all warlike hopes in their cups. There may be banquet after battle, there may be dancing after the Indian War in the palace of Staphylos; viols may let their voice be heard again after the victory in the field. But without hard work it is not possible to dwell in the inaccessible heavens. The road to the Blessed is not easy; noble deeds give the only path to the firmament of heaven by God's decree. You too then, endure hardship of every kind. Hera for all her rancour foretells for you the heavenly court of Zeus.’
