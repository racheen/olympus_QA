  </title>
  <meta content="The Moirae were the three ancient Greek goddesses of fate who personified the inescapable destiny of man. They assigned to every person his or her fate or share in the scheme of things. The individuals were Clotho who spun the thread of life, Lachesis who measured it, and Atropos who cut it short. Zeus Moiragetes, the god of fate, was their leader.The Moirai were described as ugly, old women and were sometimes lame. They were severe, inflexible and stern. Their Roman name was Parcae." name="description"/>

     THE MOIRAI (Moirae) were the three goddesses of fate who personified the inescapable destiny of man. They assigned to  every person his or her fate or share in the scheme of things. Their name means "Parts." "Shares" or "Alottted Portions." The individuals were Klotho (Clotho), the "the Spinner," who spun the thread of life, 
                        Lakhesis (Lachesis), "the Apportioner of Lots", who measured it, and 
    Atropos (or Aisa), "She who cannot be turned," who cut it short.  Zeus Moiragetes, the god of fate, was their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the birth of a man, the Moirai spinned out the thread of his future life, followed his steps, and directed the consequences of his actions according to the counsel of the gods. It was not an inflexible fate; Zeus, if he chose, had the power of saving even those who were already on the point of being seized by their fate. The Fates did not abruptly interfere in human affairs but availed themselves of intermediate causes, and determined the lot of mortals not absolutely, but only conditionally, even man himself, in his freedom was allowed to exercise a certain influence upon them. As man's fate terminated at his death, the goddesses of fate become the goddesses of death,
     <em>
      Moirai Thanatoio
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The Moirai were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction; and Zeus, as well as the other gods and man, had to submit to them. They assigned to the
     <a href="../Khthonios/Erinyes.html">
      Erinyes
     </a>
     , who inflicted the punishement for evil deeds, their proper functions; and with them they directed fate according to the laws of necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
     As goddesses of birth, who spinned the thread of life, and even prophesied the fate of the newly born,
     <a href="../Ouranios/Eileithyia.html">
      Eileithyia
     </a>
     was their companion. As goddesses of fate they must necessarily have known the future, which at times they revealed, and were therefore prophetic deities. Their ministers were all the soothsayers and oracles.
    </p>
    <p>
     As goddesses of death, they appeared together with the
     <a href="Keres.html">
      Keres
     </a>
     and the infernal
     <a href="../Khthonios/Erinyes.html">
      Erinyes
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The Moirai were described as ugly, old women and sometimes lame. They were severe, inflexible and stern. Klotho carries a spindle or a roll (the book of ate), Lakhesis a staff with which she points to the horoscope on a globe, and Atropos a scroll, a wax tablet, a sundial, a pair of scales, or a cutting instrument. At other times the three were shown with staffs or sceptres, the symbols of dominion, and sometimes even with crowns. At the birth of each man they appeared spinning, measuring, and cutting the thread of life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Romans name for the goddesses was Parcae and the names of the individuals were Nona, Decuma and Morta.

    </h2>
    <p>
     MOIRA (Moira) properly signifies "a share," and as a personification " the deity who assigns to every man his fate or his share," or the Fates. Homer usually speaks of only one Moira, and only once mentions the Moirai in the plural. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xxiv. 29.) In his poems Moira is fate personified, which, at the birth of man, spins out the thread of his future life (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xxiv. 209), follows his steps, and directs the consequences of his actions according to the counsel of the gods. (
     <em>
      11.
     </em>
     v. 613, xx. 5.) Homer thus, when he personifies Fate, conceives her as spinning, an act by which also the power of other gods over the life of man is expressed. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xxiv. 525,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     i. 17,iii. 208, iv. 208.) But the personification of his Moira is not complete, for he mentions no particular appearance of the goddess, no attributes, and no parentage; and his Moira is therefore quite synonymous with Aisa. (
     <em>
      II.
     </em>
     xx. 127, xxiv. 209.) If in
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     vii. 197, the Kataklôthes are the Moirae, and not the Eileithyiae, as some suppose, Aisa and Moira would indeed be two distinct beings, but still beings performing entirely the same functions.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Moirae, as the divinities of the duration of human life, which is determined by the two points of birth and of death, are conceived either as goddesses of birth or as goddesses of death, and hence their number was two, as at Delphi. (Paus. x. 24. § 4; Plut.
     <em>
      de Tranq. An.
     </em>
     15,
     <em>
      de Ei ap. Delph.
     </em>
     2.) From this circumstance we may perhaps infer that originally the Greeks conceived of only one Moira, and that subsequently a consideration of her nature and attributes led to the belief in two, and ultimately in three Moirae; though a distribution of the functions among the three was not strictly observed, for in Ovid, for example (
     <em>
      ad Liv.
     </em>
     239), and Tibullus (i. 8. 1.), all three are described as spinning, although this should be the function of Clotho alone, who is, in fact, often mentioned alone as the representative of all. (Pind.
     <em>
      01.
     </em>
     i. 40; Ov.
     <em>
      ad Liv.
     </em>
     164,
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     vi. 757,
     <em>
      Ex Pont.
     </em>
     iv. 15. 36.) As goddesses of birth, who spill the thread of beginning life, and even prophesy the fate of the newly born, they are mentioned along with Eileithyia, who is called their companion and paredros. (Paus. viii. 21. § 2; Plat.
     <em>
      Sympos.
     </em>
     p. 206, d.; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     vi. 70,
     <em>
      Nem.
     </em>
     vii. 1; Anton. Lib. 29; comp. Eurip.
     <em>
      Iphig. Taur.
     </em>
     207.) In a similar capacity they are also joined with Prometheus, the former, or creator of the human race in general. (Hygin.
     <em>
      Poet. Astr.
     </em>
     ii. 15.) The symbol with which they, or rather Clotho alone, are represented to indicate this function, is a spindle, and the idea implied in it was carried out so far, that sometimes we read of their breaking or cutting off the thread when life is to end. (Ov.
     <em>
      Am.
     </em>
     ii. 6. 46; Plat.
     <em>
      de Re Publ.
     </em>
     p. 616.) Being goddesses of fate, they must necessarily know the future, which at times they reveal, and thus become prophetic divinities. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     viii. 454,
     <em>
      Trist.
     </em>
     v. 3. 25; Tibull. i. 8. 1, iv. 5. 3; Catull. 64. 307.) As goddesses of death, they appear together with the Keres (Hes.
     <em>
      Scut. Herc.
     </em>
     258) and the infernal Erinnyes, with whom they are even confounded, and in the neighbourhood of Sicyon the annual sacrifices offered to them were the same as those offered to the Erinnyes. (Paus. ii. 11. § 4; comp. Schol.
     <em>
      ad Aesch. Agam.
     </em>
     70; Aelian,
     <em>
      H. A.
     </em>
     x. 33; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     i. 86.) It belongs to the same character that, along with the Charites, they lead Persephone out of the lower world into the regions of light, and are mentioned along with Pluto and Charon. (Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     428; Ov.
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     vi. 157; comp. Aristoph.
     <em>
      Ran.
     </em>
     453.) The various epithets which poets apply to the Moirae generally refer to the severity, inflexibility, and sternness of fate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Homeric Moira is not, as some have thought, an inflexible fate, to which the gods themselves must bow; but, on the contrary, Zeus, as the father of gods and men, weighs out their fate to them (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     viii. 69, xxii. 209; comp. xix. 108); and if he chooses, he has the power of saving even those who are already on the point of being seized by their fate (II. xvi. 434, 441, 443); nay, as Fate does not abruptly interfere in human affairs, but avails herself of intermediate causes, and determines the lot of mortals not absolutely, but only conditionally, even man himself, in his freedom, is allowed to exercise a certain influence upon her. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     i. 34,
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ix. 411, xvi. 685.) As man's fate terminates at his death, the goddess of fate at the close of life becomes the goddess of death, moira Danatoio (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xxiv. 29, ii. 100, iii. 238), and is mentioned along with death itself, and with Apollo, the bringer of death. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     iii. 101, v. 83, xvi. 434, 853, xx. 477, xxi. 101, xxiv. 132.)
    </p>
    <p>
     Hesiod (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     217, &amp;c., 904; comp. Apollod. i 3. § 1) has the personification of the Moirae complete; for he calls them, together with the Keres, daughters of Night; and distinguishes three, viz. Clotho, or the spinning fate; Lachesis, or the one who assigns to man his fate; and Atropos, or the fate that cannot be avoided. According to this genealogy, the Moirae must be considered as in a state of dependence upon their father, and as agreeing with his counsels. Hence he is called Moiragetês, i. e. the guide or leader of the Moirae (Paus. v. 15. § 4), and hence also they were represented along with their father in temples and works of art, as at Megara (Paus. i. 40. § 3), in the temple of Despoena in Arcadia (viii. 37. § 1), and at Delphi (x. 24. § 4; comp. viii. 42. § 2). They are further described as engraving on indestructible tables the decrees of their father Zeus. (Claudian, xv. 202; comp. Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xv. 808, &amp;c.) Later writers differ in their genealogy of the Moirae from that of Hesiod; thus they are called children of Erebus and Night (Cic.
     <em>
      De Aat. Deor.
     </em>
     iii. 17), of Cronos and Night (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     406), of Ge and Oceanus (Athenag. 15; Lycoph. 144), or lastly of Ananke or Necessity. (Plat.
     <em>
      De Re Publ.
     </em>
     p. 617, d.)
    </p>
    <p>
     It cannot be surprising to find that the character and nature of the Moirae were conceived differently at different times and by different authors. Sometimes they appear as divinities of fate in the strict sense of the term, and sometimes only as allegorical divinities of the duration of human life. In the former character they are independent, at the helm of necessity, direct fate, and watch that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws may take its course without obstruction (Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Prom.
     </em>
     511, 515); and Zeus, as well as the other gods and men, must submit to them. (Herod. i. 91; Lactant.
     <em>
      Institute.
     </em>
     i. 11, 13; Stob.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     i. pp. 152, 170.) They assign to the Erinnyes, who inflict the punishment for evil deeds, their proper functions; and with them they direct fate according to the laws of necessity, whence they are sometimes called the sisters of the Erinnyes. (Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Eum.
     </em>
     335, 962,
     <em>
      Prom.
     </em>
     516, 696, 895; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     406.) Later poets also conceive the Moirae in the same character. (Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     v. 798, xii. 147; Tibull. i. 8. 2; Ov.
     <em>
      Trist.
     </em>
     v. 3. 17,
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xv. 781; Horat.
     <em>
      Carm. Saec.
     </em>
     25, &amp;c.) These grave and mighty goddesses were represented by the earliest artists with staffs or sceptres, the symbol of dominion; and Plato (
     <em>
      De Re Pub.
     </em>
     p. 617) even mentions their crowns. (
     <em>
      Mus. Pio-Clem.
     </em>
     tom. vi. tab. B.)
    </p>
    <p>
     They had sanctuaries in many parts of Greece, such as Corinth (Paus. ii. 4. § 7), Sparta (iii. 11. § 8), Olympia (v. 15. § 4), Thebes (ix. 2.5. § 4), and elsewhere. The poets sometimes describe them as aged and hideous women, and even as lame, to indicate the slow march of fate (Catull. 64, 306; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xv. 781; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     584) ; but in works of art they are represented as grave maidens, with different attributes, viz., Clotho with a spindle or a roll (the book of fate); Lachesis pointing with a staff to the horoscope on the globe ; and Atropos with a pair of scales, or a sun-dial, or a cutting instrument. It is worthy of remark that the Muse Urania was sometimes represented with the same attributes as Lachesis, and that Aphrodite Urania at Athens, according to an inscription on a Hermes-pillar, was called the oldest of the Moirae. (Paus. i. 19. § 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
     PEPRO′MENE (Peprômenê), namely
     <em>
      etopa
     </em>
     , that is, the share destined by fate, occurs also as a proper name in the same sense as Moira or Fate. (Paus. viii. 21. § 2; Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     iii. 309.)

     They remained seated, each keeping their arms crossed. Galinthias, fearing that the pains of her labour would drive Alkmene mad, ran to the Moirai (Fates) and Eleithyia and announced that by desire of Zeus a boy had been born to Alkmene and that their prerogatives had been abolished.
     <br/>
     At all this, consternation of course overcame the Moirai and they immediately let go their arms. Alkmene's pangs ceased at once and Herakles was born. The Moirai were aggrieved at this and took away the womanly parts of Galinthias since, being but a mortal, she had deceived the gods. They turned her into a deceitful weasel, making her live in crannies and gave her a grotesque way of mating. She is mounted through the ears and gives birth by bringing forth her young through the throat.

And Klotho with the touch of her right hand helped to turn the outer circumference of the spindle, pausing from time to time. Atropos with her left hand in like manner helped to turn the inner circles, and Lakhesis alternately with either hand lent a hand to each. Now when they arrived they were straight-way bidden to go before Lakhesis, and then a certain prophet first marshalled them in orderly intervals, and thereupon took from the lap of Lakhesis lots and patterns of lives and went up to a lofty platform and spoke, `This is the word of Lakhesis, the maiden daughter of Ananke (Necessity), souls that live for a day, now is the beginning of another cycle of mortal generation where birth is the beacon of death.'"

Your lamentation has found out how to undo the inflexible threads of unturning Moira (Fate), it has turned back the irrevocable. Ampelos is not dead, even if he died; for I will change your boy to a lovely drink, a delicious nectar. He shall be worshiped with dancing beat of tripling fingers, when the double-sounding pipe shall strike up harmony over the feast, be it in Phrygian rhythm or Dorian tune; or on the boards a musical man shall sing him, pouring out the voice of Aonian reeds for Ismenians or the burghers of Marathon. The Mousai (Muses) shall cry triumph for Ampelos the lovely with Lyaios (Lyaeus) of the Vine (Ampelos). You shall throw off the twisting coronal of snakes from your head, and entwine your hair with tendrils of the vine; you shall make Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] jealous, that he holds out his melancholy iris with its leafy dirge. You too dispense a drink, the earthly image of heavenly nectar, the comfort of the human race, and your young friend shall eclipse the flowery glory of the Amyklaian (Amyclaean) boy [i.e. Hyakinthos]: if his country produces the bronze of battle, your boy's country too increases the shining torrent of red juice like a river--she is all proud of her gold, and she likes not steel. If one boasts of a roaring river, Paktolos had better water than Eurotas. Ampelos, you have brought mourning to Dionysos who never mourns--yes, that when your honeydropping wine shall grow, you my bring its delight to all the four quarters of the world, a libation for the Blessed, and for Dionysos a heart of merry cheer. Lord Bakkhos (Bacchus) has wept tears, that he may wipe away a man's tears!’
     <br/>
     Having spoke thus, the divinity departed with her sisters. 
  Then a great miracle was shown to sorrowful Bakkhos witnessing. For Ampelos the lovely dead rose of himself and took the form of a creeping snake, and became the healtrouble flower. As the body changed, his belly was along stalk, his fingers grew into toptendrils, his feet took root, his curlclusters were grapeclusters, his fawnskin changed into the manycoloured bloom of the growing fruit, his long neck became a bunch of grapes, his elbow gave place to a bending twig swollen with berries, his head changed until the horns took the shape of twisted clumps of drupes.

     </span>
     <br/>
     "To the Moirai (Moirae, Fates), Fumigation from Aromatics. Daughters of darkling Nyx (Night), much named, draw near, infinite Moirai, and listen to my prayer; who in the heavenly lake, where waters white burst from a fountain hid in depths of night, and through a dark and stony cavern glide, a cave profound, invisible abide; from whence, wide coursing round the boundless earth, your power extends to those of mortal birth; to men with hope elated, trifling, gay, a race presumptuous, born but to decay. To these acceding, in a purple veil to sense impervious, you yourselves conceal, when in the plain of Moira (Fate) you joyful ride in one great car, with glory for your guide; till all-complete, your heaven appointed round, at justice, hope, and care's concluding bound, the terms absolved, prescribed by ancient law, of power immense, and just without a flaw. For Moira (Fate) alone with vision unconfined surveys the conduct of the mortal kind. Moira (Fate) is Zeus' perfect eternal eye, for Zeus and Moira our every deed descry. Come, gentle powers, well born, benignant, famed, Atropos, Lakhesis (Lachesis), and Klotho (Clotho) named; unchanged, aerial, wandering in the night, untamed, invisible to mortal sight; Moirai all-producing, all-destroying, hear, regard the incense and the holy prayer; propitious listen to these rites inclined, and far avert distress, with placid mind."
