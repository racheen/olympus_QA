   IRIS - Greek Goddess of the Rainbow, Messenger of the Gods
  </title>
  <meta content="Iris was the ancient Greek goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods. She was often described as the handmaiden and personal messenger of Hera. Her name contains a double meaning, being connected the Greek words for both rainbow and messenger. Iris was depicted as a beautiful young woman with golden wings, a herald's rod, and sometimes a water-pitcher in her hand." name="description"/>

     IRIS was the goddess of the rainbow and the messenger of the Olympian gods. She was often described as the handmaiden and personal messenger of
     <a href="../Olympios/Hera.html">
      Hera
     </a>
     . 
Iris was a goddess of sea and sky--her father Thaumas "the wondrous" was a marine-god, and her mother Elektra "the amber" a cloud-nymph. For the coastal-dwelling Greeks, the rainbow's arc was most often seen spanning the distance beteween cloud and sea, and so the goddess was believed to replenish the rain-clouds with water from the sea. Iris had no distinctive mythology of her own. In myth she appears only as an errand-running messenger and was usually described as a virgin goddess. Her name contains a double meaning, being connected with both the Greek word
     <em>
      iris
     </em>
     "the rainbow" and
     <em>
      eiris
     </em>
     "messenger."
    </p>
    <p>
     Iris is depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a beautiful young woman with golden wings, a herald's rod (
     <em>
      kerykeion
     </em>
     ), and sometimes a water-pitcher (
     <em>
      oinochoe
     </em>
     ) in her hand. She was usually depicted standing beside Zeus or Hera, sometimes serving nectar from her jug. As cup-bearer of the gods Iris is often  indistinguishable from

In accordance with these functions of Iris, her name is commonly derived from erô eirô; so that Iris would mean "the speaker or messenger:" but it is not impossible that it may be connected with eirô, "I join," whence eirênê ; so that Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, would be the joiner or conciliator, or the messenger of heaven, who restores peace in nature. In the Homeric poems, it is true, Iris does not appear as the goddess of the rainbow, but the rainbow itself is called iris (
     <em>
      Il
     </em>
     xi. 27, xvii. 547): and this brilliant phenomenon in tile skies, which vanishes as quickly as it appears, was regarded as the swift minister of the gods. Her genealogy too supports the opinion that Iris was originally the personification of the rainbow. In the earlier poets, and even in Theocritus (xvii. 134) and Virgil (
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     v. 610) Iris appears as a virgin goddess; but according to later writers, she was married to Zephyrus, and became by him the mother of Eros. (Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     pp. 391, 555; Plut.
     <em>
      Amat.
     </em>
     20.) With regard to her functions, which we have above briefly described, we may further observe, that the Odyssey never mentions Iris, but only Hermes as the messenger of the gods: in the Iliad, on the other hand, she appears most frequently, and on the most different occasions. She is principally engaged in the service of Zeus, but also in that of Hera, and even serves Achilles in calling the winds to his assistance. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xxiii. 199.) She further performs her services not only when commanded, but she sometimes advises and assists of her own accord (iii. 122, xv. 201. xviii. 197. xxiv. 74, &amp;c.). In later poets she appears on the whole in the same capacity as in the Iliad, but she occurs gradually more and more exclusively in the service of Hera, both in the later Greek and Latin poets. (Callim.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Del.
     </em>
     232; Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     v. 606; Apollon. Rhod. ii. 288, 432; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xiv. 830, &amp;c.) Some poets describe Iris actually as the rainbow itself, but Servius (
     <em>
      ad Aen
     </em>
     v. 610) states that the rainbow is only the road on which Iris travels, and which therefore appears whenever the goddess wants it, and vanishes when it is no longer needed: and it would seem that this latter notion was the more prevalent one in antiquity. Respecting the worship of Iris very few traces have come down to us, and we only know that the Delians offered to her on the island of Hecate cakes made of wheat and honey and dried figs. (Athen. xiv. p. 645; comp. Müller,
     <em>
      Aegin.
     </em>
     p. 170.) No statues of Iris have been preserved, but we find her frequently represented on vases and in bas-reliefs, either standing and dressed in a long and wide tunic, over which hangs a light upper garment, with wings attached to her shoulders, and carrying the herald's staff in her left hand; or she appears flying with wings attached to her shoulders and sandals, with the staff and a pitcher in her hands.

And the other kept watch over the far-flung islands, even Thaumantia [Iris daughter of Thaumas] seated on Mimas, whither she had sped. There they sat and threatened all the cities which Leto approached and prevented them from receiving her . . . 
  After much toil She [Leto pregnant with Apollon and Artemis and forced to wander the earth by the rage of Hera] came unto the Isles (Nesoi) of the sea. But they received her not when she came--not the Ekhinades (Echidnades) with their smooth anchorage for ships, not Kerkyra (Corcyra) which is of all other islands most hospitable, since Iris on lofty Mimas was wroth with them all and utterly prevented them.

Leto is undoing her girdle within and island. All the others spurned her and received her not; but Asteria called her by name as she was passing by--Asteria that evil scum of the sea: thou knowest it thyself. But, dear Lady,--for thou canst-- defend thy servants, who tread the earth at thy behest.’

     So she spake and seated her beside the golden throne, even as a hunting hound of Artemis, which, when it hath ceased from the swift chase, sitteth by her feet, and its ears are erect, ever ready to receive the call of the goddess. Like thereto Thaumantias (daughter of Thaumas) sat beside the throne. And she never forgetteth her seat, not even when sleep lays upon her his forgetful wing, but there by the edge of the great throne with head a little bent aslant she sleeps. Never does she unloose her girdle or her swift hunting-boots lest her mistress give her some sudden command. And Hera was grievously angered and spake to her : ‘So now, O shameful creatures of Zeus, may ye all wed in secret and bring forth in darkness.’"

Speed away on your light wings and ask Thetis to come here to me out of the salt sea depths. I need her. After that, go to the seacoast where the bronze anvils of Hephaistos (Hephaestus) are pounded by his mighty hammers, and tell him to let his bellows sleep till Argo has passed by. Next, go to Aiolos (Aeolus), king of the sky-born winds, and to him too convey my wishes, which are that he should order all the winds of heaven to cease . . .’

Near the Cimmerii a cavern lies deep in the hollow of a mountainside, the home and sanctuary of lazy Somnus [Hypnos] . . . There Iris entered, brushing the Somnia (Dreams) [Oneiro] aside, and the bright sudden radiance of her robe lit up the hallowed place; slowly the god his heavy eyelids raised, and sinking back time after time, his languid drooping head nodding upon his chest, at last he shook himself out of himself, and leaning up he recognized her and asked why she came, and she replied : ‘Somnus [Hypnos], quietest of the gods, Somnus, peace of all the world, balm of the soul, who drives care away, who gives ease to weary limbs after the hard day's toil and strength renewed to meet the morrow's tasks, bid now thy Somnia (Dreams), whose perfect mimicry matches the truth, in Ceyx's likeness formed appear in Trachis to Alcyone and feign the shipwreck and her dear love drowned. So Juno [Hera] orders.’
     <br/>
     Then, her task performed, Iris departed, for she could no more endure the power of Somnus [Hypnos], as drowsiness stole seeping through her frame, and fled away back o'er the arching rainbow as she came . . . The old god chose Morpheus to undertake Thaumantias' [Iris'] commands."

     Hither from the blue sky came in balanced flight the varicoloured maid [Iris the rainbow]; the forests shine out, and the shady glens smile upon the goddess, and smitten with her zones of radiance the palace starts from its sleep; but he himself, awoken neither by the bright glow nor by the sound or voice of the goddess, lay motionless as ever, till the Thaumantian [Iris] shot at him all her splendours and sank deep into his drowsy vision. Then thus began to speak the golden fashioner of clouds : ‘Somnus [Hypnos], gentlest of the gods, Juno [Hera] bids thee bind fast the Sidonian [Theban] leaders and the folk of ruthless Cadmus, who now, puffed up by the issue of fight, are watching in ceaseless vigil the Achaean rampart, and refuse thy sway. Grant so solemn a request--rarely is this opportunity vouchsafed, to win the favour of Jove [Zeus] with Juno [Hera] on thy side.’

     She spoke, and with her hand beat upon his languid breast, and charged him again and yet again, lest her message be lost.

Seek also about seagirt Lemnos, and if you find him tell him to charm the eyes of Zeus uncharmable for one day, that I may help the Indians. But change your shape, take the ugly form of Hypnos' mother the blackgirdled goddess Nyx (Night); take a false name and become darkness . . . Promise him Pasithea for his bride, and let him do my need from desire of her beauty. I need not tell you that one lovesick will do anything for hope.’
     <br/>
     At these words, Iris goldenwing flew away peering through the air . . . seeking the wandering track of vagrant Hypnos (Sleep). She found him on the slopes of nuptial Orkhomenos (Orchomenus) . . . Then Iris changed her shape, and all unseen she put on the look of dark Nyx unrecognisable. She came near to Hypnos, weaving guile; and in his mother’s guise uttered her deceitful speech in cajoling whispers . . . Iris begged him to fasten Kronion with slumber for the course of one day only . . . Then goddess Iris returned flying at speed and hastened to deliver her welcome message to her queen."

Iris obeyed and gliding down to earth along her many-coloured bow addressed Hersilie in the words prescribed; and she in awe and reverence would hardly raise her eyes. ‘Goddess,’ she answered, ‘who thou art I cannot well surmise, but clear it is thou art a goddess.’ . . .
     <br/>
     Quickly she reached the hill of Romulus with Thaumantea [Iris]. There a star from heaven dropped gliding to the ground and by its glow set the queen's hair ablaze, and with the star Hersilie ascended to the sky."

     "Father Zeus sent Iris to the divine halls of Rheia, to inform wakethefray Dionysos, that he must drive out of Asia with his avenging thyrsus the proud race of Indians untaught of justice: he was to sweep from the sea the horned son of a river, Deriades the king, and teach all nations the sacred dances of the vigil and the purple fruit of vintage.
     <br/>
     She paddled her way with windswift beat of wings, and entered the echoing den of stabled lions. Noisless her step she stayed, in silence voiceless pressed her lips, a slave before the forest queen. She stood bowing low, and bent down her head to kiss Rheia’s feet with suppliant lips. Rheia unsmiling beckoned, and the Korybantes (Corybantes) served her beside the bowl of the divine table. Wondering she drank a sop of the newfound wine, delighted and excited; then with heavy head the spirit told the will of Zeus to the son of Zeus : ‘O mighty Dionysos! Your father bids you destroy the race of Indians, untaught of piety. Come, lift the thyrsus of battle in your hands, and earnheaven by your deeds. For the immortal court of Zeus will not receive you without hard work, and the Horai (Horae, Seasons) will not open the gates of Olympos to you unless you have struggled for the prize. Hermeias (Hermes) hardly could win his way to heaven, and only when he had killed with his rod Argos the cowherd, sparkling with eyes from his feet to the hair of his head, and when he had set Ares free from prison [captured in a jar by the Aloidai (Aloadae)]. Apollon mastered Delphyne [Python], and then he came to live in the sky. Even your own father, chief of the Blessed, Zeus Lord in the Highest, did not rise to heaven without hard work, he the sovereign of the stars: first he must bind fast those threateners of Olympos, the Titanes, and hide them deep in the pit of Tartaros. You also do your work, after Apollon, after Hermaon (Hermes), and your prize for your labours will be a home in your father's heaven.’

     "Dionysos, did not escape the jealousy of trick-stitching Hera. Still resentful of your divine birth, she sent her messenger Iris on an evil errand, mingling treacherous persuasion with craft, to bewitch you and deceive your mind; and she gave her an impious poleaxe, that she might hand it to the king of Arabia, Lykourgos (Lycurgus), Dryas' son. The goddess made no delay. She assumed a false pretended shape of Ares, and borrowed a face like his. She threw off her embroidered saffron robes, and put on her head a helmet with nodding plume, donned a delusive corselet, as the mother of battle, a corselet stained with blood, and sent froth from her grim countenance, like a man, battlestirring menaces, all delusion. Then with fluent speech she mimicked the voice of Enyalios [Ares] : ‘My son, scion of invincible Ares [and persuades Lykourgos to attack Dionysos] . . .’
     <br/>
     So he spoke, and goldenwing Iris divine smiled to hear; then went her way, paddling in the false shape of a falcon . . . And Iris, by Hera's command, put the winged shoe on her feet, and holding a rod like Hermes the messenger of Zeus, flew up to warn of what was coming. To Bakkhos (Bacchus) in corselet of bronze she spoke deceitful words : ‘Brother, son of Zeus Allwise, put war aside, and celebrate your rites with Lykourgos, a willing host . . .’

     So she cajoled him, and the shoes carried her high into the air."

     MESSENGER           IRIS IN COMEDY

     The appearance of Iris in Greek comedy was anticipated by her earlier appearance in the satyr-plays of the tragedians.

      Aristophanes, Birds 574 (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.) :

      Aristophanes, Birds 1196 ff (trans. O'Neill) (Greek comedy C5th to 4th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[In this comedy the Birds have built a fortress in the air blocking the gods' access to the earth :]
     <br/>
     Leader of the Chorus [of Birds] : Scan all sides with your glance. Hark! methinks I can hear the rustle of the swift wings of a god from heaven.
     <br/>
     (The Machine brings in Iris (Goddess of the Rainbow), in the form of a young girl.)
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos (Pisthetaerus) : Hi! you woman! where, where, are you flying to? Halt, don't stir! keep motionless! not a beat of your wing! (She pauses in her flight.) Who are you and from what country? You must say whence you come.
     <br/>
     Iris : I come from the abode of the Olympian gods.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : What's your name, ship or head-dress?
     <br/>
     Iris : I am swift Iris.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairo s: Paralos or Salaminia?
     <br/>
     Iris : What do you mean?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Let a buzzard rush at her and seize her.
     <br/>
     Iris : Seize me? But what do all these insults mean?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Woe to you!
     <br/>
     Iris : I do not understand it.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : By which gate did you pass through the wal [of the city of the birds]l, wretched woman?
     <br/>
     Iris : By which gate? Why, great gods, I don't know.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : You hear how she holds us in derision. Did you present yourself to the officers in command of the jays? You don't answer. Have you a permit, bearing the seal of the storks?
     <br/>
     Iris : Am I dreaming?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Did you get one?
     <br/>
     Iris : Are you mad?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : No head-bird gave you a safe-conduct?
     <br/>
     Iris : A safe-conduct to me. You poor fool!
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Ah! and so you slipped into this city on the sly and into these realms of air-land that don't belong to you.
     <br/>
     Iris : And what other roads can the gods travel?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : By Zeus! I know nothing about that, not I. But they won't pass this way. And you still dare to complain? Why, if you were treated according to your deserts, no Iris would ever have more justly suffered death.
     <br/>
     Iris : I am immortal.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : You would have died nevertheless.-Oh! that would be truly intolerable! What! should the universe obey us and the gods alone continue their insolence and not understand that they must submit to the law of the strongest in their due turn? But tell me, where are you flying to?
     <br/>
     Iris : I? The messenger of Zeus to mankind, I am going to tell them to sacrifice sheep and oxen on the altars and to fill their streets with the rich smoke of burning fat.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Of which gods are you speaking?
     <br/>
     Iris : Of which? Why, of ourselves, the gods of heaven.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : You, gods?
     <br/>
     Iris : Are there others then?
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Men now adore the birds as gods, and it's to them, by Zeus, that
     <br/>
     they must offer sacrifices, and not to Zeus at all!
     <br/>
     Iris (in tragic style) : Oh! fool! fool! fool! Rouse not the wrath of the gods, for it is terrible indeed. Armed with the brand of Zeus, justice would annihilate your race; the lightning would strike you as it did Likymnios and consume both your body and the porticos of your palace.
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Here! that's enough tall talk. Just you listen and keep quiet! Do you take me for a Lydian or a Phrygian and think to frighten me with your big words? Know, that if Zeus worries me again, I shall go at the head of my eagles, who are armed with lightning, and reduce his dwelling and that of Amphion to cinders. I shall send more than six hundred
     <em>
      porphyrions
     </em>
     (water-hens) clothed in leopards' skins up to heaven against him; and formerly a single Porphyrion [the giant-king that attacked heaven] gave him enough to do. As for you, his messenger, if you annoy me, I shall begin by getting between your thighs, and even though you are Iris, you will be surprised at the erection the old man can produce; it's three times as good as the ram on a ship's prow!
     <br/>
     Iris : May you perish, you wretch, you and your infamous words!
     <br/>
     Pisthetairos : Won't you get out of here quickly? Come, stretch your wings or look out for squalls!
     <br/>
     Iris : If my father [Zeus] does not punish you for your insults . . .
