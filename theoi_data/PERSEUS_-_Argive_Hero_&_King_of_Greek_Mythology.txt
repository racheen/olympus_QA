   PERSEUS - Argive Hero &amp; King of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="Perseus was one of the most celebrated heroes of Greek mythology. King Polydectes commanded he fetch the head of Medusa. With the help of the gods, Perseus obtained winged sandals, an invisible helm and a magical sword. He then sought out the ancient Graeae and stealing their single eye compelled them to reveal the location of the Gorgons. Perseus approached Medusa as she slept and beheaded her with eyes averted to avoid her petrifying visage." name="description"/>

    <p>
     PERSEUS was one of the most celebrated  heroes of Greek mythology.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was the son of the Argive princess Danae who was locked away in a bronze chamber by her father Akrisios (Acrisius) who lived in fear of a prophecy that he would one day be killed by her son. The god Zeus, however, infiltrated her prison in the guise of a golden shower and impreganted her. When Akrisios discovered the child, he placed the two in a chest and set them adrift at the sea. They were carried safely to the island of Seriphos where they were offered refuge by the kindly, fisherman Diktys.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Perseus was fully grown, King Polydektes (Polydectes) commanded he fetch the head of
     <a href="../Pontios/Gorgones.html">
      Medousa (Medusa)
     </a>
     . With the help of the gods, Perseus obtained winged sandals, an invisible helm and a magical sword. He then sought out the ancient
     <a href="../Pontios/Graiai.html">
      Graiai (Graeae)
     </a>
     and stealing their single eye compelled them to reveal the location of the
     <a href="../Pontios/Gorgones.html">
      Gorgones
     </a>
     . Perseus approached Medousa as she slept and beheaded her with eyes averted to avoid her petrifying visage.
    </p>
    <p>
     On his journey back to Greece, Perseus came across the Aithiopian (Ethiopian) princess Andromeda chained to a rock as a sacrifice to a
     <a href="../Ther/KetosAithiopios.html">
      sea-monster
     </a>
     . He slew the beast and brought her with him back to Greece as his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon reaching Seriphos, the hero turned King Polydektes to stone, and then travelled on to his grandfather's kingdom to claim the throne. The old man fled in fear for his life but was later accidentally killed by Perseus at the funeral games of a king with a discus throw gone awry.
    </p>
    <p>
     Perseus was the ancestor of the royal houses of Mykenai (Mycenae), Elis, Sparta, Messenia, and distant Persia. His most famous descendant was Herakles.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hero  was depicted in classical art as a youth with winged boots and cap, and armed with a sickle-shaped sword.

     PERSEUS (Perseus). The famous Argive hero, was a son of Zeus and Danae, and a grandson of Acrisius (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xiv. 310; Hes.
     <em>
      Scut. Herc.
     </em>
     229). Acrisius, who had no male issue, consulted the Pythian oracle, and received the answer, that if Danae should give birth to a son, he would kill his father. Acrisius, accordingly, shut up his daughter in a subterraneous apartment, made of brass or stone (Soph.
     <em>
      Ant.
     </em>
     947; Lycoph. 838 ; Horat.
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     iii. 16). But Zeus having metamorphosed himself into a shower of gold, came down upon her through the roof of the apartment, and became by her the father of Perseus. From this circumstance Perseus is sometimes called
     <em>
      chrusopatros
     </em>
     or
     <em>
      aurigena
     </em>
     (Lycoph. 838; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     v. 250). When Acrisius discovered that Danaë had given birth to a son, he threw both mother and son into a chest, and put them out to sea; but Zeus caused the chest to land in the island of Seriphos, one of the Cyclades, where Dictys, a fisherman, found them, and carried them to his brother, king Polydectes. According to a later or Italian tradition, the chest was carried to the coast of Italy, where king Pilumnus married Danaë, and founded Ardea (Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     vii. 410; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     vii. 372); or Danaë is said to have come to Italy with two sons, Argus and Argeus, whom she had by Phineus, and took up her abode on the spot where Rome was afterwards built (Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     viii. 345). But, according to the common story, Polydectes, king of Seriphos, made Danae his slave, and courted her favour, but in vain; and in order to obtain the undisturbed possession of her, he sent off Perseus, who had in the meantime grown up to manhood, to the Gorgons, to fetch the head of Medusa, which he said he would give to Hippodameia as a wedding present (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     838). Another account again states that Polydectes married Danaë, and caused Perseus to be brought up in the temple of Athena. When Acrisius learnt this, he went to Polydectes, who, however, interfered on behalf of the boy, and the latter promised not to kill his grandfather. Acrisius. however, was detained in Seriphos by storms, and during that time Polydectes died. During the funeral gaines the wind carried a disk thrown by Perseus against the head of Acrisius, and killed him, whereupon Perseus proceeded to Argos and took possessions of the kingdom of his grandfather (Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab
     </em>
     . 63). But to return to the common tradition, Athena, with whom Medusa had ventured to contend for the prize of beauty, first showed to Perseus the head of Gorgo in images, near the town of Diecterion in Samos, and advised him to be unconcerned about the two immortal Gorgons, Stheno and Euryale. Perseus then went first to the Graeae, the sisters of the Gorgons, took from them their one tooth and their one eye, and did not restore them to the Graeae until they showed him the way to the nymphs; or he cast the tooth and the eye into lake Triton, so that the Graeae were no longer able to guard the Gorgons (Hygin.
     <em>
      Poet. Astr.
     </em>
     ii. 12). The nymphs provided Perseus with winged sandals, a bag, and the helmet of Hades, which rendered him invisible, Hermes with a sickle, and Athena with a mirror (Hes.
     <em>
      Scut. Her.
     </em>
     220, 222 ; Eurip.
     <em>
      Elect.
     </em>
     460; Anthol. Palat. ix. 557; comp. Hygin.
     <em>
      Poet. Astr.
     </em>
     ii. 12; Theon,
     <em>
      ad Arat.
     </em>
     p. 29). Being thus armed, he went to the Gorgons, who dwelt near Tartessus on the coast of the Ocean, whose heads were covered, like those of serpents, with scales, and who had large tusks like boars, brazen hands, and golden wings. He found them asleep, and cut off the head of Medusa, looking at her figure through the mirror, for a look at the monster herself would have changed him into stone. Perseus put her head into the bag which he carried on his back, and as he went away, he was pursued by the winged Gorgons (Hes.
     <em>
      Scut. Here.
     </em>
     230 ; Paus. v. 118. § 1). On his return he visited Aethiopia, where he saved and married Andromeda, by whom he became the father of Perses, whom he left with Cepheus. During this journey Perseus is also said to have come to the Hyperboreans, by whom he was hospitably received (Pind.
     <em>
      Pyth.
     </em>
     x. 50), and to Atlas, whom, by the head of Gorgo, he changed into the mountain of the same name (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     iv. 655; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 246). Phineus, the brother of Cepheus, was likewise changed into stone, and when Perseus returned to Seriphos he found his mother with Dictys in the temple, whither she had fled from the embraces of Polydectes. Perseus found the latter at a repast, and metamorphosed him and all his guests, and, some say, the whole island, into stone (Pind.
     <em>
      Pyth.
     </em>
     xii. 21; Strab. x. p. 487), and presented the kingdom to Dictys. Perseus then gave the winged sandals and the helmet to Hermes, who restored them to the nymphs and to Hades, and Athena received the head of Gorgo, which was put on the shield or breast-plate of the goddess. Hereupon Perseus went to Argos, accompanied by Cyclopes, skilled in building (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Or.
     </em>
     953), by Danaë, and Andromeda. Acrisius, remembering the oracle, escaped to Larissa, in the country of the Pelasgians; but Perseus followed him, in order to persuade him to return (Paus. ii. 16. § 6). Some writers state that Perseus, on his return to Argos. found Proetus who had expelled his brother Acrisius, in possession of the kingdom (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     v. 236, &amp;c.); Perseus slew Proetus, and was afterwards killed by Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, who avenged the death of his father. (Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     244.) Some again relate that Proetus was expelled, and went to Thebes. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Phoen.
     </em>
     1109.) But the common tradition goes on thus: when Teutamidas, king of Larissa, celebrated games in honour of his guest Acrisius, Perseus, who took part in them, accidentally hit the foot of Acrisius, and thus killed him. Acrisius was buried outside the city of Larissa, and Perseus, leaving the kingdom of Argos to Megapenthes, the son of Proetus, received from him in exchange the government of Tiryns. According to others, Perseus remained in Argos, and successfully opposed the introduction of the Bacchic orgies. (Paus. ii. 20. § 3, 22. § 1 ; comp. Nonn.
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xxxi. 25.) Perseus is said to have founded the towns of Mideia and Mycenae. (Paus. ii. 15. § 4.) By Andromeda he became the father of Alcaeus, Sthenelus, Heleius, Mestor, Electryon, Gorgophone, and Autochthe, (Apollod. ii. 4. §§ 1-5; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     494, 838; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     iv. 606, &amp;c.; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Apollon. Rhod.
     </em>
     iv. 1091.) Perseus was worshipped as a hero in several places, e.g. between Argos and Mycenae, in Seriphos, and at Athens, where he had an altar in common with Dictys and Clymene. (Paus. ii. 18. § 1.) Herodotus (ii. 91) relates that a temple and a statue of Perseus existed at Chemnis in Egypt, and that the country was blessed whenever he appeared.

     "Abas [king of Argos] and Aglaia (Aglaea), daughter of Mantineus, had twin sons Akrisios (Acrisius) and Proitos (Proetus). These two were at odds with each other while still in the womb, and when they had grown they warred over the kingdom. In the course of fighting they became the first to develop the use of shields. Akrisios won and drove Proitos out of Argos. Proitos made his way to Iobates, or, according to some, to Amphianax in Lykia (Lycia), and married his daughter, whom Homeros (Homer) calls Anteia, although the tragic poets call her Stheneboia (Stheneboea). Proitos' father-in-law with the Lykian army conducted him home again, where he seized Tiryns, which had been walled for him by the Kyklopes (Cyclopes). The two brothers then split up all of Argeia [Argolis] between them and settled down, Akrisios lord of Argos, and Proitos lord of Tiryns."

     "To Akrisios (Acrisius) and Eurydike (Eurydice), Lakedaimon's (Lacedaemon's) daughter, was born a daughter Danae . . . While Akrisios was making oracular inquiry into the problem of fathering sons, the god informed him that a son born of his daughter would slay him. In fear Akrisios constructed a bronze chamber beneath the earth, where he kept Danae under guard. Now some say that Proitos (Proetus) seduced her, which led to the hard feelings between the brothers, but others say that Zeus had sex with her by changing himself into gold that streamed in through the ceiling and down into her womb. When Akrisios later learned that she had given birth to Perseus, not believing that Zeus seduced her, he cast his daughter out to sea with her son on an ark. The ark drifted ashore at Seriphos, where Diktys (Dictys) recovered the child and brought him up."

     "Danae was the daughter of Acrisius and Aganippe. A prophecy about her said that the child she bore would kill Acrisius, and Acrisius, fearing this, shut her in a stone-walled prison. But Jove [Zeus], changing into a shower of gold, lay with Danae, and from this embrace Perseus was born. Because of her sin her father shut her up in a chest with Perseus and cast it into the sea. By Jove's [Zeus'] will it was borne to the island of Seriphus, and when the fisherman Dictys found it and broke it open, he discovered the mother and child. He took them to King Polydectes, who married Danae and brought up Perseus in the temple of Minerva [Athena]."

    <h4>
     SYNOPSES
    </h4>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-greek">
      Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca 2. 36 - 42 (trans. Aldrich) (Greek mythographer C2nd A.D.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "The ruler of Seriphos was Polydektes (Polydectes), Diktys' (Dictys') brother. He fell in love with Danae, but was unable to have sex with her, now that Perseus was a grown man, so he got together his friends, Perseus among them, and told them he was collecting contributions to offer for the hand of Hippodameia, daughter of Oinomaos (Oenomaus). He asked for horses from the others, but, because he got no horses from Perseus and because Perseus had said that he would not deny Polydektes even the Gorgo's [Medousa's] head, he assigned him the task of fetching that very object.
     <br/>
     So with Hermes and Athene as his guides Perseus sought out the Phorkides (daughters of Phorkys) [the Graiai (Graeae)], who were named Enyo, Pephredo, and Deino. The three of them possessed only one eye and one tooth among them, which they took turns using. Perseus appropriated these and when they demanded them back, he said he would return them after they had directed him to the Nymphai (Nymphs). These Nymphai had in their possession winged sandals and the kibisis, which they say was a knapsack.--Pindaros and Hesiodos in the
     <em>
      Shield of Herakles
     </em>
     , describe Perseus as follows : ‘The head of a terrible monster, Gorgo, covered all his back, and a kibisis held it.’ It is called a
     <em>
      kibisis
     </em>
     because clothing and food are placed in it.--They also had the helmet of Haides. When the Phorkides had led Perseus to the Nymphai, he returned them their tooth and eye. Approaching the Nymphai he received what he had come for, and he flung on the
     <em>
      kibisis
     </em>
     , tied the sandals on his ankles, and placed the helmet on his head. With the helmet on he could see whomever he cared to look at, but was invisible to others.
     <br/>
     Perseus took flight and made his way to the Okeanos (Oceanus), where he found the Gorgones sleeping. Their names were Stheno, Euryale, and the third was Medousa (Medusa), the only mortal one : thus it was her head that Perseus was sent to bring back. The Gorgones' heads were entwined with the horny scales of serpents, and they had big tusks like hogs, bronze hands, and wings of gold on which they flew. All who looked at them were turned to stone. Perseus, therefore, with Athena guiding his hand, kept his eyes on the reflection in a bronze shield as he stood over the sleeping Gorgones, and when he saw the image of Medousa, he beheaded her.--As soon as her head was severed there leaped from her body the winged horse Pegasos (Pegasus) and Khrysaor (Chrysaor), the father of Geryon. The father of these two was Poseidon.--Perseus then placed the head in the kibisis and headed back again, as the Gorgones pursued him through the air. But the helmet kept him hidden, and made it impossible for them to identify him."

     <span class="quote-latin">
      Pseudo-Hyginus, Astronomica 2. 13 (trans. Grant) (Roman mythographer C2nd A.D.) :

     "He is said to have come to the stars because of his nobility and the unusual nature of his conception. When sent by Polydectes, son of Magnes, to the Gorgones, he received from Mercurius [Hermes], who is thought to have loved him,
     <em>
      talaria
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      petasus
     </em>
     , and, in addition, a helmet which kept its wearer from being seen by an enemy. So the Greeks have called it the helmet of Haides [the Unseen], though Perseus did not, as some ignorant people interpret it, wear the helmet of Orcus [Haides] himself, for no educated person could believe that. He is said, too, to have received from Vulcanus [Hephaistos] a knife made of adamant, with which he killed Medusa the Gorgon. The deed itself no one has described. But as Aeschylus, the writer of tragedies, says in his
     <em>
      Phorcides
     </em>
     , the Graeae were guardians of the Gorgons. We wrote about them in the first book of the
     <em>
      Genealogiae
     </em>
     . They are thought to have had but one eye among them, and thus to have kept guard, watch one taking it in her turn. This eye Perseus snatches, as one was passing it to another, and threw is in Lake Tritonis. So, when the guards were blinded, he easily killed the Gorgon when she was overcome with sleep. Minerva [Athena] is said to have the head on her breastplate. Euhemerus says the Gorgon was killed by Minerva."

On his feet he had winged sandals, and his black-sheathed sword was slung across his shoulders by a cross-belt of bronze. He was flying swift as thought. The head of a dreadful monster, the Gorgo, covered the broad of his back, and a bag of silver--a marvel to see--contained it: and from the bag bright tassels of gold hung down. Upon the head of the hero lay the dread cap of Aides (Hades) which had the awful gloom of night. Perseus himself, the son of Danae, was at full stretch, like one who hurries and shudders with horror. And after him rushed the Gorgones, unapproachable and unspeakable, longing to seize him : as they trod upon the pale adamant, the shield rang sharp and clear with a loud clanging. Two serpents hung down at their girdles with heads curved forward: their tongues were flickering, and their teeth gnashing with fury, and their eyes glaring fiercely. And upon the awful heads of the Gorgones great Phobos (Fear) was quaking."

From those dread maidens'  lips was heard streaming, and from those writhing serpent heads untouchable, when Perseus o'er [Medousa (Medusa)] the third of those fell sisters launched his cry of triumph, and bropught fatal doom to Seriphos by the sea--doom for that isle and for her people. Yes, for he had made blind the grim  offspring of Phorkys (Phorcys), and bitter the wedding-gift he brought to Polydektes (Polydectes), thus to end his mother's long slavery and enforced wedlock--that son of Danaë, who raped the head of the fair-cheeked Medousa; he who, men tell, was from a flowing stream of gold betotten. But when the goddess maid delivered from these labours the man she loved, then she contrived the manifold melodies of the flute, to make in music's notes an image of the shrill lamenting cries, strung from Euryale's ravening jaws. A goddess found, but finding, gave the strain to mortal men to hold, naming it the tune of many heads."

I omit the miraculous, but give the rational parts of the story about her. After the death of her father, Phorkys (Phorcys), she reigned over those living around Lake Tritonis, going out hunting and leading the Libyans to battle. On one such occasion, when she was encamped with an army over against the forces of Perseus, who was followed by picked troops from the Peloponnesos, she was assassinated by night. Perseus, admiring her beauty even in death, cut off her head and carried it to show the Greeks.
     <br/>
     But Prokles (Procles), the son of Eukrates, a Carthaginian, thought a different account more plausible than the preceding. It is as follows. Among the incredible monsters to be found in the Libyan desert are wild men and wild women. Prokles affirmed that he had seen a man from them who had been brought to Rome. So he guessed that a woman wandered from them, reached Lake Tritonis, and harried the neighbours until Perseus killed her; Athena was supposed to have helped him in this exploit, because the people who live around Lake Tritonis are sacred to her."

     "One of the dinner-companions [at the Ethiopian wedding of Perseus and Andromeda] asked in turn, ‘Now, valiant Perseus, pray tell the story of the deed, that all may know, and what the arts and power prevailed, when you struck off the serpent-covered head.’
     <br/>
     ‘There is,’ continued Perseus of the house of Agenor, ‘There is a spot beneath cold Atlas, where in bulwarks of enormous strength, to guard its rocky entrance, dwelt two sisters [the Graeae], born of Phorcys. These were wont to share in turn a single eye between them: this by craft I got possession of, when one essayed to hand it to the other.--I put forth my hand and took it as it passed between : then, far, remote, through rocky pathless crags, over wild hills that bristled with great woods, I thence arrived to where the Gorgon dwelt. Along the way, in fields and by the roads, I saw on all sides men and animals--like statues--turned to flinty stone at sight of dread Medusa's visage. Nevertheless reflected on the brazen shield, I bore upon my left, I saw her horrid face. When she was helpless in the power of sleep and even her serpent-hair was slumber-bound, I struck, and took her head sheer from the neck.--To winged Pegasus the blood gave birth, his brother [Chrysaor] also, twins of rapid wing.’
     <br/>
     So did he speak, and truly told besides the perils of his journey, arduous and long--He told of seas and lands that far beneath him he had seen, and of the stars that he had touched while on his waving wings."

There was no battle when swiftshoe Perseus lifted the lifeless token of victory, the snaky sheaf of Gorgon hair, relics of the head dripping drops of blood, gently wheezing a half-heard hiss through the severed throats . . . Perseus fled with flickering wings trembling at the hiss of mad Sthenno's hairy snakes, although he bore the cap of Haides and the sickle of Pallas [Athena], with Hermes' wings though Zeus was his father; he sailed a fugitive on swiftest shoes, listening for no trumpet but [the Gorgon] Euryale's bellowing--having despoiled a little Libyan hole!"

     "A fearsome snake lay in the [Libyan] sand, sheltering from the midday sun. It was too sluggish to attack a man who showed now wish to harm it, or to fly at anyone who shrank away. And yet, for any creature living on the face of Mother Earth, one drop of its black poison in his veins was short cut to the world below . . . For when the godlike Perseus, whom his mother called Eurymedon, flew over Libye (Libya) brining the Gorgon's newly severed head to the king, every drop of dark blood that fell from it to the ground produced a brood of these serpents."

      Ovid, Metamorphoses 4. 617 ff (trans. Brookes More) (Roman epic C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :

     <br/>
     "So mighty is the hidden power of truth, Acrisius soon lamented  . . . that ever he refused to own his grandson; for the one achieved high heaven, and the other, (as he bore the viperous monster-head) on sounding wings hovered a conqueror in the fluent air, over sands, Libyan, where the Gorgon-head dropped clots of gore, that, quickening on the ground, became unnumbered serpents; fitting cause to curse with vipers that infested land. Thence wafted by the never-constant winds through boundless latitudes, now here now there, as flits a vapour-cloud in dizzy flight, down-looking from the lofty skies on earth, removed far, so compassed he the world. Three times did he behold the frozen Bears, times thrice his gaze was on the Crab's bent arms. Now shifting to the west, now to the east, how often changed his course? Time came, when day declining, he began to fear the night, by which he stopped his flight far in the west--the realm of Atlas--where he sought repose till Lucifer (the Morning Star) might call Aurora's (the Dawn's) [Eos'] fires; Aurora chariot of the Day.
     <br/>
     There dwelt huge Atlas, vaster than the race of man : son of Iapetus, his lordly sway extended over those extreme domains, and over oceans that command their waves to take the panting coursers of the Sun, and bathe the wearied Chariot of the Day. For him a thousand flocks, a thousand herds overwandered pasture fields; and neighbour tribes might none disturb that land. Aglint with gold bright leaves adorn the trees,--boughs golden-wrought bear apples of pure gold. And Perseus spoke to Atlas, ‘O my friend, if thou art moved to hear the story of a noble race, the author of my life is Jupiter [Zeus]; if valiant deeds perhaps are thy delight mine may deserve thy praise.--Behold of thee kind treatment I implore--a place of rest.’
     <br/>
     But Atlas, mindful of an oracle since by Themis, the Parnassian, told, recalled these words, ‘O Atlas! mark the day a son of Jupiter [Zeus] shall come to spoil; for when thy trees been stripped of golden fruit, the glory shall be his.’ Fearful of this, Atlas had built solid walls around his orchard, and secured a dragon, huge, that kept perpetual guard, and thence expelled all strangers from his land. Wherefore he said, ‘Begone! The glory of your deeds is all pretense; even Jupiter, will fail your need.’ With that he added force and strove to drive the hesitating Alien from his doors; who pled reprieve or threatened with bold words. Although he dared not rival Atlas' might, Perseus made this reply; ‘For that my love you hold in light esteem, let this be yours.’ He said no more, but turning his own face, he showed upon his left Medusa's head, abhorrent features.--Atlas, huge and vast, becomes a mountain--His great beard and hair are forests, and his shoulders and his hands mountainous ridges, and his head the top of a high peak;--his bones are changed to rocks. Augmented on all sides, enormous height attains his growth; for so ordained it, ye, O mighty Gods! who now the heavens' expanse unnumbered stars, on him command to rest."
