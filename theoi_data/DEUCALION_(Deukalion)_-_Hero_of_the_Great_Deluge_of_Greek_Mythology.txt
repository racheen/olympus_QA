   DEUCALION (Deukalion) - Hero of the Great Deluge of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Deucalion and Pyrrha were the first king and queen of the northern reaches of Greece. Deucalion was the son of Prometheus, creator of mankind, and Pyrrha the daughter of Pandora, the first woman. The couple lived in the time of the Bronze Race of Mankind--a third, warlike generation born after the virtuous Silver and Gold races. Zeus was angered by their impiety and destroyed them with the Great Deluge. Only Deucalion and Pyrrha survived the apocalypse--having been warned of the impending calamity by Prometheus. Mounting a chest the couple found refuge on the dry peaks of Mount Parnassus." name="description"/>

     DEUKALION (Deucalion) and PYRRHA were the first king and queen of the northern reaches of Greece--Opountian Lokris (Opuntian Locris), Malis, Phthiotis and Thessalia (Thessaly). Deukalion was the son of Prometheus, creator of mankind, and Pyrrha   the daughter of Pandora, the first woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     The couple lived in the time of the Bronze Race of Mankind--a third, warlike generation born after the virtuous Silver and Gold races. Zeus was angered by their impiety and destroyed them with the Great Deluge. Only Deukalion and Pyrrha survived the apocalypse--having been warned of the impending calamity by Prometheus. Mounting a chest the couple found refuge the dry peaks of Mount Parnassos. Other regions also claimed survivors--King Dardanos was said to have sought refuge on Mount Ida in the Troad, Kerambos was carried to the heights of Mount Othrys by the Nymphs, Megaros  fled to Mount Gerana, Arkas and Nyktimos were preserved on Mount Kyllene in Arkadia, and the tribes of Parnassos fled to the heights above Delphoi.
     <a href="../Heroine/Io.html">
      Io
     </a>
     and her son Epaphos, who lived in Egypt, were also preserved. Zeus then let the waters to recede and, in the north
     <a href="../Olympios/Poseidon.html">
      Poseidon
     </a>
     , split the  mountains at the Vale of Tempe to release the waters trapped in the Thessalian plain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deukalion and Pyrrha consulted the Delphic oracle asking how they might repopulate the now desolate earth and were told to cast the bones of their mother over their shoulders. They mulled on the riddle and realised the bones were the stones of
     <a href="../Protogenos/Gaia.html">
      Mother Earth
     </a>
     --casting these, Deuckalion producing a tribe of men and Pyrrha women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Deukalion had a number of sons and daughters. The most famous of these were Hellen, the eponymous king of the Hellenes (i.e. the Greeks), and three maidens loved by the god Zeus--Pandora (who was named after her maternal grandmother), Protogeneia and Thyia. Deukalion's descendants ruled  most of the kingdoms of  Greece in the mythic age. His most famous great-grandsons included Sisyphos,
     <a href="Salmoneus.html">
      Salmoneus
     </a>
     , Athamas, Diktys and Polydektes, Ion and
     <a href="Endymion.html">
      Endymion
     </a>
     . The intervening generations consisted mostly of eponyms--that is, figures who gave their names to tribes or places and which had little or no mythology.

     DEUCALION (Deukaliôn), a son of Prometheus and Clymene. He was king in Phthia, and married to Pyrrha. When Zeus, after the treatment he had received from Lycaon, had resolved to destroy the degenerate race of men who inhabited the earth, Deucalion, on the advice of his father, built a ship, and carried into it stores of provisions; and when Zeus sent a flood all over Hellas, which destroyed all its inhabitants, Deucalion and Pyrrha alone were saved. After their ship had been floating about for time days, it landed, according to the common tradition, on mount Parnassus; others made it land on mount Othrys in Thessaly, on mount Athos, or even on Aetna in Sicily. (Schol.
     <em>

     </em>
     ix. 64; Serv.

     153.) These differences in the story are probably nothing but local traditions; in the same manner it was believed in several places that Deucalion and Pyhrra were not the only persons that were saved. Thus Megarus, a son of Zeus, escaped by following the screams of cranes, which led him to the summit of mount Gerania (Paus. i. 40. § 1); and the inhabitants of Delphi were said to have been saved by following the howling of wolves, which led them to the summit of Parnassus, where they founded Lycoreia. (Paus. x. 6. § 2.) When the waters had subsided, Deucalion offered up a sacrifice to Zeus Phyxius, that is, the helper of fugitives, and thereupon the god sent Hermes to him to promise that he would grant any wish which Deucalion might entertain. Deucalion prayed that Zeus might restore mankind. According to the more common tradition, Deucalion and Pyrrha went to the sanctuary of Themis, and prayed for the same thing. The goddess bade therm cover their heads and throw the bones of their mother behind them in walking from the temple. After some doubts and scruples respecting the meaning of this command, they agreed in interpreting the bones of their mother to mean the stones of the earth; and they accordingly threw stones behind them, and from those thrown by Deucalion there sprang up men, and from those of Pyrrha women. Deucalion then descended from Parnassus, and built his first abode at Opus (Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     ix. 46), or at Cynus (Strab. ix. p. 425; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     ix. 64), where in later times the tomb of Pyrrha was shown. Concerning the whole story, see Apollod. i. 7. § 2; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 260, &amp;c. There was also a tradition that Deucalion had lived at Athens, and the sanctuary of the Olympian Zeus there was regarded as his work, and his tomb also was shown there in the neighbourhood of the sanctuary. (Paus. i. 18. § 8.) Deucalion was by Pyrrha the father of Hellen, Amphictyon, Protogeneia, and others. Strabo (ix. p. 435) states, that near the coast of Phthiotis there were two small islands of the name of Deucalion and Pyrrha.

The Pelasgian race has never yet left its home [Arkadia (Arcadia)]; the Hellenic has wandered often and far. For in the days of king Deukalion (Deucalion) it inhabited the land of Phthia, then the country called Histiaian [i.e. ‘Land of the Hearth’], under Ossa and Olympos, in the time of Doros (Dorus) son of Hellen; driven from this Histiaian country by the Kadmeans, it settled about Pindos (Pindus) in the territory called Makedonian; from there again it migrated to Dryopia [i.e. Ozolean Lokris (Locris)], and at last came from Dryopia into the Peloponnesos, where it took the name of Dorian."

The Thessalians in early times were not permitted by the [river] Peneios (Peneus) to have any land at all, since mountains encompassed the level spaces, which the stream continually flooded because it had as yet no outlet. Therefore Poseidon will break through the mountains with his trident and open a gateway for the river. Indeed, this is the work which he has now undertaken, the mighty task of uncovering the plains; his hand is raised to break the mountains apart, but, before the blow has fallen, they separate a sufficient space to let the river through. In the painter's effort to make the action clear, the right side of Poseidon has been at the same time both drawn back and advanced and he threatens to strike his blow, not merely with his hand but with his whole body. He is painted, not dark blue nor yet as a god of the sea, but as a god of the mainland. Accordingly he greets the plains as he sees that they are both broad and level like stretches of the sea. The river also rejoices as one exulting . . . Thessalia [the land personified] emerges, the water already subsiding; she wears tresses of olive and grain and grasps a colt that emerges along with her. For the horse also is to be her gift from Poseidon, when the earth shall receive the seed of the god while he sleeps and shall bear a horse."

     "[The Arcadian King Lycaon tried to serve Jupiter-Zeus a meal of human flesh. The god destroyed him and his sons for the impiety and then, at a council of the gods, declared that he would cleanse the earth with a Great Deluge.]
     <br/>
     [Jupiter-Zeus speaks :] ‘Thus fell one house, but not one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail,--all men conspire in evil. Let them therefore feel the weight of dreadful penalties so justly earned, for such hath my unchanging will ordained.’
     <br/>
     With exclamations some [of the other gods] approved the words of Jove [Zeus] and added fuel to his wrath, while others gave assent : but all deplored and questioned the estate of earth deprived of mortals. Who could offer frankincense upon the altars? Would he suffer earth to be despoiled by hungry beasts of prey? Such idle questions of the state of man the King of Gods forbade, but granted soon to people earth with race miraculous, unlike the first.
     <br/>
     And now his thunder bolts would Jove [Zeus] wide scatter, but he feared the flames, unnumbered, sacred ether might ignite and burn the axle of the universe: and he remembered in the scroll of fate, there is a time appointed when the sea and earth and Heavens shall melt, and fire destroy the universe of mighty labour wrought. Such weapons by the skill of Cyclops forged, for different punishment he laid aside--for straightway he preferred to overwhelm the mortal race beneath deep waves and storms from every raining sky.
     <br/>
     And instantly he shut Aquilo (the North-Wind) in Aeolian caves, and every other wind that might dispel the gathering clouds. He bade Notus (the South-Wind) blow:--the Southwind flies abroad with dripping wings, concealing in the gloom his awful face: the drenching rain descends from his wet beard and hoary locks; dark clouds are on his brows and from his wings and garments drip the dews: his great hands press the overhanging clouds; loudly the thunders roll; the torrents pour; Iris, the messenger of Juno [Hera], clad in many coloured raiment, upward draws the steaming moisture to renew the clouds. The standing grain is beaten to the ground, the rustic's crops are scattered in the mire, and he bewails the long year's fruitless toil.
     <br/>
     The wrath of Jove was not content with powers that emanate from Heaven; he brought to aid his azure brother, lord of flowing waves, who called upon the Rivers and the Streams: and when they entered his impearled abode, Neptunus [Poseidon], their ancient ruler, thus began; ‘A long appeal is needless; pour ye forth in rage of power; open up your fountains; rush over obstacles; let every stream pour forth in boundless floods.’
     <br/>
     Thus he commands, and none dissenting all the River Gods return, and opening up their fountains roll tumultuous to the deep unfruitful sea. And Neptunus with his trident smote the Earth, which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources of her waters bare; and through her open plains the rapid rivers rushed resistless, onward bearing the waving grain, the budding groves, the houses, sheep and men,--and holy temples, and their sacred urns. The mansions that remained, resisting vast and total ruin, deepening waves concealed and whelmed their tottering turrets in the flood and whirling gulf. And now one vast expanse, the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves--a sea without a shore.
     <br/>
     One desperate man seized on the nearest hill; another sitting in his curved boat, plied the long oar where he was wont to plow; another sailed above his grain, above his hidden dwelling; and another hooked a fish that sported in a leafy elm. Perchance an anchor dropped in verdant fields, or curving keels were pushed through tangled vines; and where the gracile goat enjoyed the green, unsightly seals reposed. Beneath the waves were wondering Nereides, viewing cities, groves and houses. Dolphins darting mid the trees, meshed in the twisted branches, beat against the shaken oak trees. There the sheep, affrayed, swim with the frightened wolf, the surging waves float tigers and lions : availeth naught his lightning shock the wild boar, nor avails the stag's fleet footed speed. The wandering bird, seeking umbrageous groves and hidden vales, with wearied pinion droops into the sea. The waves increasing surge above the hills, and rising waters dash on mountain tops. Myriads by the waves are swept away, and those the waters spare, for lack of food, starvation slowly overcomes at last.
     <br/>
     A fruitful land and fair but now submerged beneath a wilderness of rising waves, 'Twixt Oeta and Aonia, Phocis lies, where through the clouds Parnassus' summits twain point upward to the stars, unmeasured height, save which the rolling billows covered all: there in a small and fragile boat, arrived, Deucalion and the consort of his couch [i.e. Pyrrha], prepared to worship the Nymphae Corycidae (Corycian Nymphs), the mountain deities (
     <em>
      numina montis
     </em>
     ), and Themis kind, who in that age revealed in oracles the voice of fate. As he no other lived so good and just, as she no other feared the Gods.
     <br/>
     When Jupiter [Zeus] beheld the globe in ruin covered, swept with wasting waves, and when he saw one man of myriads left, one helpless woman left of myriads lone, both innocent and worshiping the gods, he scattered all the clouds; he blew away the great storms by the cold northwind. Once more the earth appeared to heaven and the skies appeared to earth. The fury of the main abated, for the sea ruler laid his trident down and pacified the waves, and called on azure Triton.--Triton arose above the waving seas, his shoulders mailed in purple shells.--He bade the Triton blow, blow in his sounding shell, the wandering streams and rivers to recall with signal known: a hollow wreathed trumpet, tapering wide and slender stemmed, the Triton took amain and wound the pearly shell at midmost sea. Betwixt the rising and the setting suns the wildered notes resounded shore to shore, and as it touched his lips, wet with the brine beneath his dripping beard, sounded retreat: and all the waters of the land and sea obeyed. Their fountains heard and ceased to flow; their waves subsided; hidden hills uprose; emerged the shores of ocean; channels filled with flowing streams; the soil appeared; the land increased its surface as the waves decreased: and after length of days the trees put forth, with ooze on bending boughs, their naked tops.
     <br/>
     And all the wasted globe was now restored, but as he viewed the vast and silent world Deucalion wept and thus to Pyrrha spoke; ‘O sister! wife! alone of woman left! My kindred in descent and origin! Dearest companion of my marriage bed, doubly endeared by deepening dangers borne,--of all the dawn and eve behold of earth, but you and I are left--for the deep sea has kept the rest! And what prevents the tide from overwhelming us? Remaining clouds affright us. How could you endure your fears if you alone were rescued by this fate, and who would then console your bitter grief? Oh be assured, if you were buried in the waves, that I would follow you and be with you! Oh would that by my father's art I might restore the people, and inspire this clay to take the form of man. Alas, the Gods decreed and only we are living!’
     <br/>
     Thus Deucalion's plaint to Pyrrha;--and they wept. And after he had spoken, they resolved to ask the aid of sacred oracles,--and so they hastened to Cephissian waves which rolled a turbid flood in channels known. Thence when their robes and brows were sprinkled well, they turned their footsteps to the goddess' fane : its gables were befouled with reeking moss and on its altars every fire was cold. But when the twain had reached the temple steps they fell upon the earth, inspired with awe, and kissed the cold stone with their trembling lips, and said; ‘If righteous prayers appease the gods, and if the wrath of high celestial powers may thus be turned, declare, O Themis! whence and what the art may raise humanity? O gentle goddess help the dying world!’
     <br/>
     Moved by their supplications, she replied; ‘Depart from me and veil your brows; ungird your robes, and cast behind you as you go, the bones of your great mother.’ Long they stood in dumb amazement: Pyrrha, first of voice, refused the mandate and with trembling lips implored the goddess to forgive--she feared to violate her mother's bones and vex her sacred spirit. Often pondered they the words involved in such obscurity, repeating oft: and thus Promethides [Deucalion son of Prometheus] to Epimethis [Pyrrha daughter of Epimetheus] uttered speech of soothing import; ‘Oracles are just and urge not evil deeds, or naught avails the skill of thought. Our mother is the Earth, and I may judge the stones of earth are bones that we should cast behind us as we go.’
     <br/>
     And although Titania [Pyrrha the Titan's daughter] by his words was moved she hesitated to comply; and both amazed doubted the purpose of the oracle, but deemed no harm to come of trial. They, descending from the temple, veiled their heads and loosed their robes and threw some stones behind them. It is much beyond belief, were not receding ages witness, hard and rigid stones assumed a softer form, enlarging as their brittle nature changed to milder substance,--till the shape of man appeared, imperfect, faintly outlined first, as marble statue chiseled in the rough. The soft moist parts were changed to softer flesh, the hard and brittle substance into bones, the veins retained their ancient name. And now the Gods supreme ordained that every stone Deucalion threw should take the form of man, and those by Pyrrha cast should woman's form assume: so are we hardy to endure and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung.
     <br/>
     And after this the Earth spontaneous produced the world of animals, when all remaining moistures of the mirey fens fermented in the sun, and fruitful seeds in soils nutritious grew to shapes ordained. So when the seven streamed Nile from oozy fields returneth duly to her ancient bed, the sun's ethereal rays impregn the slime, that haply as the peasants turn the soil they find strange animals unknown before: some in the moment of their birth, and some deprived of limbs, imperfect; often part alive and part of slime inanimate are fashioned in one body. Heat combined with moisture so conceives and life results from these two things. For though the flames may be the foes of water, everything that lives begins in humid vapour, and it seems discordant concord is the means of life. When Earth, spread over with diluvian ooze, felt heat ethereal from the glowing sun, unnumbered species to the light she gave, and gave to being many an ancient form, or monster new created."

     "[Nonnos describes the great Deluge in astrological terms :] After the first Dionysos [i.e. Zagreus, the elder Dionysos] had been slaughtered [by the Titanes (Titans)], Father Zeus learnt the trick of the mirror with its reflected image. He attacked [Gaia the Earth] the mother of the Titanes with avenging brand, and shut up the murderers of horned Dionysos within the gate of Tartaros: the trees blazed, the hair of suffering Gaia (Earth) was scorched with heat. He kindled the East : the dawnlands of Baktria (Bactria) blazed under blazing bolts, the Assyrian waves set afire the neighbouring Kaspian (Caspian) Sea and the Indian mountains, the Red Sea rolled billows of flame and warmed Arabian Nereus. The opposite West also fiery Zeus blasted with his thunderbolt in love for his child; and under the foot of Zephyros the western brine half-burnt spat out a shining stream; the Northern ridges-- even the surface of the frozen Northern Sea bubbled and burned : under the clime of snowy Aigokeros (Aegocerus) [i.e. the constellation Capricorn] the Southern corner boiled with hotter sparks.
     <br/>
     Now Okeanos (Oceanus) poured rivers of tears from his watery eyes, a libation of suppliant prayer. Then Zeus calmed his wrath at the sight of the scorched earth; he pitied her, and wished to wash with water the ashes of ruin and the fiery wounds of the land. The Rainy Zeus covered the whole sky with clouds and flooded all the earth. Zeus's heavenly trumpet bellowed with its thunderclaps, while all the stars moved in their appointed houses :  when Helios (the Sun) in his four-horse chariot drove shining over the Lion's [Leo's] back, his own house; the Moon of threefold form rolled in her onrunning car over the eightfoot Crab [Cancer]; Kypris (Cypris) [i.e. the planet Venus] in her equinoctial course under the dewy region had left the Ram's [Aries] horn behind, and held her spring-time house in the heavenly Bull [Taurus] which knows no winter; the Sun's neighbour Ares [i.e. the planet Mars] possessed the Scorpion, harbinger of the Plow, encircled by the blazing Bull, and ogled Aphrodite [star Venus] opposite with a sidelong glance; Zeus of nightfall [i.e. the planet Jupiter], the twelvemonth traveller who completes the lichtgang, was treading on the starry Fishes [Pisces], having on his right he round-faced Moon in trine; Kronos (Cronus) [i.e. the planet Saturn] passed through the showery back of Aigokeros (Aegocerus) [Capricorn] drenched in the frosty light; round the bright Maiden [Virgo], Hermes [i.e. the planet Mercury] was poised on his pinions, because as a dispenser of justice he had Justice for his house.
     <br/>
     Now the barriers of the sevenzoned watery sky were opened, when Zeus poured down his showers. The mountain-torrents roared with fuller fountains of the loudsplashing gulf. The lakes, liquid daughters cut off from Okeanos, raised their surface. The fountains shot spouts of the lower water of Okeanos into the air. The cliffs were besprinkled, the dry thirsty hills were drenched as with rivers streaming over the heights: the sea rose until Nereïdes became Oreades on the hills over the woodland. O poor thing! Maid Ekho (Echo) had to swim with unpractised hands, and felt a new fear for that old maiden zone--Pan she had escaped, but she might be cause by Poseidon! Sea-lions now leaped with dripping limbs in the land-lions' cave among rocks they knew not, and in the depths of a mountain-torrent a stray boar met with a dolphin of the sea. Wild beasts and fishes navigated in common stormy floods that poured from the mountains. The many-footed squid dragged his many coils into the hills, and pounced on the hare. The dripping Tritones at the edge of a secret wood wagged their green forked tails against their flanks, and hid in the mountain vaults where Pan had his habitation, leaving their familiar speckled conchs to sail about with the winds. Nereus on his travels met rock-loving Pan on a submerged hill, the rock-dweller left his sea and changed it for the hill, leaving the waterlogged pan's-pipes that floated; while he took to the watery cave where Ekho had sheltered.
     <br/>
     Then the bodies of poor fellows swollen in their watery death were buried in the waters. Heaps of corpses were floating one upon another carried along by the rolling currents; there fell the lion, there fell the boar into the roaring torrent, with open throat gulping draughts of the cascades that poured from rocks and mountains. With mingling streams, lakes and rivers, torrents of rain, waters of the sea were all combined together, and the four winds united their blasts in one, to flog the universal inundation.
     <br/>
     Earthshaker [Poseidon] saw from the deep the earth all flooded, while Zeus alone with stronger push made it quake under his threatening torrents: he threw away his prongs, wondering in his anger what earth now he could heave with a trident! Nereïdes in battalions swam over the flooding waves; Thetis travelled over the water riding on the green hip of a Triton with broad beard; Agauë on a fish's back drove her pilotfish in the open air, and an exile dolphin with the water swirling round his neck lifted Doris and carried her along. A whale of the deep sea leaped about the hills and sought the cave of the earthbedded lioness . . .
     <br/>
     As the irresistible torrent swelled on and on, every city, every nation was a flood; not one corner was undrenched, not one hill was then bare--not the peak of Ossa, not the top of Pelion. Under the three peaks roared the Tyrrhenian Sea; the Adriatic rocks rebounded with Sicilian waters in showers of foam from the flogging sea. The sparkling rays of Phaëthon [Helios the sun] in his airy course became soft and womanish in the torrents. Selene (the Moon) in her seventh zone over the low rim of the earth cooled her light in the mounting waves, and checked her cattle with drenched and soaking necks. The rainwater mixed with the starry battalions, and made the Milky Way whiter with foam.
     <br/>
     The Neilos (Nile), pouring his lifegiving stream through his seven mouths, went astray and met love-sick Alpheios (Alpheus) . . . ‘The earth quakes, the sky attacks us, the sea compels us, the unnavigable upper air itself swells in a foaming flood! I care not for the wild deluge. See what a great miracle! The blazing earth, the flaming sea, the rivers--all have been swept clean by the downpour of Zeus . . .’
     <br/>
     Then also Deukalion passed over the mounting flood, to navigate far out of reach on a sky-traversing voyage; and the course of his ark selfguided selfmoving, without sheet and without harbour, scored the stormy waters.
     <br/>
     Then the whole frame of the universe would have been unframed, then all-breeding Time would have dissolved the whole structure of the unsown generations of mankind: but by the divine ordination of Zeus, Poseidon Seabluehair with earthsplitting trident split the midmost peak of the Thessalian mountain, and dug a cleft through it by which the water ran sparkling down. Earth shook off the stormy flood which travelled so high, and showed herself risen again; the streams were driven into the deep hollows and the cliffs were laid bare. The sun poured his thirsty rays on the wet face of earth, and dried it; the water grew thick under the hotter beams, and he mud was dried again as before. Cities were fashioned by men with better skill and established upon stone foundations, palaces were built, and the streets of the new-founded cities were made strong for later generations of men. Nature laughed once more; the air once more was paddled by the wings of birds that flew in the winds."

      Nonnus, Dionysiaca 7. 22 ff :

     <br/>
     "Aion (Time) the maniform, holding the key of generation, spread his white shock of hair over the knees of Zeus, let fall the flowing mass of his beard in supplication . . . : ‘Lord Zeus! behold yourself the sorrows of a despairing world! . . . We can yet see traces of that Deluge which you brought upon all nations, when the streams of airy floods billowed in the air and boiled against the neighbouring Moon.’"
