    <p>
     The Greek word for constellations was
     <em>
      katasterismoi
     </em>
     . Of these, the twelve signs whose paths intersect  with the dawn rising of the sun were known as
     <em>
      zodiakos
     </em>
     (the zodiac) or
     <em>
      zodiakos kyrklos
     </em>
     (circle of small animals). The constellations, as described in Greek mythology, were mostly god-favoured heroes and beasts who received a place  amongst the stars as a memorial of their deeds. They were regarded as semi-divine spirits--living, conscious entities which strode across the heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
     The main sources of Greek star myths were the lost astronomical poems of Hesiod and Pherecydes and later works by Pseudo-Eratosthenes,
     <a href="../Text/AratusPhaenomena.html">
      Aratus
     </a>
     and
     <a href="../Text/HyginusAstronomica.html">
      Hyginus
     </a>
     .

    <p>
     For those unfamiliar with the basic visible mechanics of constellar movement, what follows is a brief outline, including Greek beliefs regarding the behaviour of the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     The constellations revolve round a central point in the northern sky known as the pole star, or heavenly axis (Greek
     <em>
      polos
     </em>
     ). Because of its far northern location, most of the stars  are seen to rise in the east and set in the west. Only those few closest to the pole--namely, Ursa Major and Minor (the Bears), and Draco (the Dragon)--appear to travel at night in an eternal circle around the pole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not all of the constellations are visible in the night sky throughout the year. The first appearance of a constellation in the sky, occurs on the western horizon just prior to dawn (its so-called heliacal rising). As the months progress it is seen to rise earlier and earlier in the night, and gradually assumes a higher position in the heavens  prior to dawn, until one evening, it has reached the western horizon, before dissappearing completely from view (which is known as the constellation's astronomical setting).
    </p>
    <p>
     The most important of the heliacal risings were those of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. They were said to rule the heavens for the period in which their position on the eastern horizon prior to dawn was replaced by the rising sun. So, for example, Gemini first rises above the eastern horizon in late May, appearing in the sky just prior to dawn, where its position is immediately replaced by the rising sun. As the constellation gradually rises earlier and earlier in the night, its place on the solar horizon at dawn is eventually replaced by the next constellation of the zodiac, namely Cancer, in mid June.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Greeks imagined the heavens as a great, solid dome, which, some say, was forged of bronze, and  upon which the heavenly constellations were fixed. The Titan Atlas, who stood either beneath the axis of heaven in the far north (in the land of the Hyperboreans), or at heaven's western rim in by the Atlas mountains in North Africa, was said to spin the dome around upon his shoulders, causing the stars to rise and set.
    </p>
    <p>
     Part of the heavenly dome always lay beneath the horizon. Here the constellations were apparently believed to dwell deep beneath the earth in the misty pit of Tartaros, or else within the lands of the dead. When they rose up into the heavens, the constellations were first bathed in the purifying waters of the great earth-encircling river Okeano. Various myths  describe the birth and death of the semi-immortal constellations: such as the Gemini twins, or Dioskouroi, who were said to divide their time equally between Heaven and Haides. Orion was also described by Homer both striding across the heavens and hunting wild beasts in the underworld.
    </p>

    <h2>
     IMAGES OF THE CONSTELLATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
     There are very few surviving depictions of the constellations in classical art: at most, a few Roman mosaics, and a partial depiction on the famous Farnese statue of the Titan Atlas.
    </p>
    <p>
     The images on this page are from a Renaissance-era ceiling fresco (circa 1573) decorating the Villa Farnese in Caprarola, Italy.

     * The form and arrangment of the heavenly constellations was adopted by the Greeks from the sea-trading Phoenicians of the East, who in turn had received them from the Assyrians, and they from their forefathers the ancient Sumerians. As a result the Greeks had a number of alternate myths describing each of the star groups, as the foreign traditions were translated in different ways by the various regions and poetical traditions of ancient Greece.

     CONSTELLATIONS &amp; THE ADVENTURES OF HERACLES
    </h2>
    <p>
     Heracles, "glory of the air," had his labours represented amongst the stars of heaven. The formula was evidently adopted from eastern sources, in particular the star myths of the so-called "Phoenician Heracles," the hero-god of Lebanon, Melqart. A number of his labours, although missing from the late Greek constellar arrangements, are perhaps recognisable in their older Eastern forms.
    </p>
    <p>
     The adventures of Heracles can be paired with the following constellations : 
  (1) the Nemean Lion, constellation Leo; (2) the Hydra and Crab, constellations Hydra and Cancer; (3) the Stymphalian Birds, constellations Lyra and Cygnus; (4) the Cretan Bull, constellation Taurus; (5) the Hesperian Dragon, constellation Serpens; (6) Herakles wrestling Apollon, constellation Gemini; (7) Prometheus and the Caucasian Eagle, constellations Hercules and Aquilla; (8) the centaur Cheiron or Pholus, constellation Saggitarius or Centaurus; et. al.

Poseidon in wrath sent a sea-monster to devour the girl. When she was chained to the rocks, the hero Perseus spied her, slew the beast, and carried her off as his wife. The gods as a memorial, set the whole family amongst the stars as constellations. (Hyginus 2.11, Aratus 197.)
