   HORAE (Horai) - Greek Goddesses of the Seasons &amp; the Natural Order
  </title>
  <meta content="The Horae were the ancient Greek goddesses of the seasons and the natural portions of time. They presided over the revolutions of the heavenly constellations by which the year was measured, while their three sisters, the Moirae, spinned out the web of fate. The Horae also guarded the gates of Olympus and rallied the stars and constellations of heaven." name="description"/>

     THE HORAI (Horae) were the goddesses of the seasons and the natural portions of time. They presided over the revolutions of the heavenly constellations by which the year was measured, while their three sisters, the Moirae (Moirae) spinned out the web of fate. The Horai also guarded the gates of Olympos and rallied the stars and constellations of heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Horai were particularly honoured by farmers who planted and tended their crops in time with the rising and setting of the stars--measures of the passing seasons. The three were usually named Eunomia (Good Order, Good Pasture), Eirene (Peace, Spring), and Dike (Justice) goddesses who individually represented the conditions required for farming prosperity. The association of agriculture with law and order can also be found in the divinities of Zeus,

     and the

     HORAE (Hôrai), originally the personifications or goddesses of the order of nature and of the seasons, but in later times they were regarded as the goddesses of order in general and of justice. In Homer, who neither mentions their parents nor their number, they are the Olympian divinities of the weather and the ministers of Zeus; and in this capacity they guard the doors of Olympus, and promote the fertility of the earth, by the various kinds of weather they send down. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xxiv. 343; comp. x. 469, xix. 132,
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     v. 749, viii. 393 ) As the weather, generally speaking, is regulated according to the seasons, they are further described as the goddesses of the seasons, i. e. the regular phases under which Nature manifests herself. (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     ii. 107, x. 469, xi. 294, xix. 152, xxiv. 141.) They are kind and benevolent, bringing to gods and men many things that are good and desirable. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xxi. 450; comp.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth.
     </em>
     16; Theocrit. xv. 105; Ov.
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     i. 125.) As, however, Zeus has the power of gathering and dispersing the clouds, they are in reality only his ministers, and sometimes also those of Hera. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     viii. 433; comp. Moschus,
     <em>
      Idyll.
     </em>
     ii. 160; Paus. v. 11. § 2.) Men in different circumstances regard the course of time (or the seasons) either as rapid or as slow, and both epithets are accordingly applied to the Horae. (Theocr. xv. 104; Pind.
     <em>
      Nem.
     </em>
     iv. 34; Horat. (
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     iv. 7. 8; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ii. 118.) The course of the seasons (or hours) is symbolically described by the dance of the Horae; and, in conjunction with the Charites, Hebe, Harmonia, and Aphrodite, they accompany the songs of the Muses, and Apollo's play on the lyre, with their dancing. (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Apoll. Pyth.
     </em>
     16, &amp;c.; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     iv. 2; Xen.
     <em>
      Sympos.
     </em>
     7.) The Homeric notions continued to be entertained for a long time afterwards, the Horae being considered as the givers of the various seasons of the year, especially of spring and autumn, i. e. of Nature in her bloom and maturity. At Athens two Horae, Thallo (the Hora of spring) and Carpo (the Hora of autumn), were worshipped from very early times. (Paus. ix. 35. § 1; comp. Athen. xiv. p. 636; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ii. 1118, &amp;c.; Val. Flacc. iv. 92; Lucian,
     <em>
      Dial. Deor.
     </em>
     x. 1.) The Hora of spring accompanies Persephone every year on her ascent from the lower world; and the expression of
     <em>
      "
     </em>
     The chamber of the Horae opens" is equivalent to "The spring is coming." (Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     xlii. 7; Pind.
     <em>
      Fragm.
     </em>
     xlv. 13, p. 576, ed. Bocckh.) The attributes of spring-flowers, fragrance, and graceful freshness are accordingly transferred to the Horae; thus they adorned Aphrodite as she rose from the sea, made a garland of flowers for Pandora, and even inanimate things are described as deriving peculiar charms from the Horae. (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     viii. 5, &amp;c.; Hes.
     <em>
      Op.
     </em>
     65; Hygin.
     <em>
      Poet. Astr.
     </em>
     ii. 5; Theocr. i. 150; Athen. ii. p. 60.) Hence they bear a resemblance to and are mentioned along with the Charites, and both are frequently confounded or identified. (Paus. ii. 17. § 4; Müller,
     <em>
      Orchom.
     </em>
     p. 176, &amp;c. 2nd edit.) As they were conceived to promote the prosperity of every thing that grows, they appear also as the protectresses of youth and newly-born gods (Paus. ii. 13. § 3; Pind.
     <em>
      Pyth.
     </em>
     ix. 62; Philostr.
     <em>
      Imag.
     </em>
     i. 26; Nonnus,
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xi. 50); and the Athenian youths, on being admitted along the ephebi, mentioned Thallo, among other gods, in the oath they took in the temple of Agraulos. (Pollux, viii. 106.)
    </p>
    <p>
     In this, as in many other cases of Greek mythology, a gradual transition is visible, from purely physical to ethical notions, and the influence which the Horae originally had on nature was subsequently transferred to human life in particular. The first trace of it occurs even in Hesiod, for he describes them as giving to a state good laws, justice, and peace; he calls them the daughters of Zeus and Themis, and gives them the significant names of Eunomia, Dice, and Eirene.
     <em>
      (Theog.
     </em>
     901, &amp;c.; Apollod. i. 3. § 1; Diod. v. 72.) But the ethical and physical ideas are not always kept apart, and both are often mixed up with each other, as in Pindar. (
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     iv. 2, xiii. 6,
     <em>
      Nem.
     </em>
     iv. 34; Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     42.) The number of the Horae is different in the different writers, though the most ancient number seems to have been two, as at Athens (Paus. iii. 18. § 7, ix. 35. § 1); but afterwards their common number is three, like that of the Moerae and Charites. Hyginus (
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     183) is in great confusion respecting the number and names of the Horae, as he mixes up the original names with surnames, and the designations of separate seasons or hours. In this manner he first makes out a list of ten Horae, viz. Titanis, Auxo, Eunomia, Pherusa, Carpo, Dice, Euporia, Eirene, Orthosia, and Thallo, and a second of eleven, Auge, Anatole, Musia, Gymnasia, Nymphes, Mesembria, Sponde, Telete, Acme, Cypridos, Dysis. The Horae (Thallo and Carpo) were worshipped at Athens, and their temple there also contained an altar of Dionysus Orthus (Athen. i. p. 38; comp. xiv. p. 656; Hesych.
     <em>
      s.v.
     </em>
     hôraia); they were likewise worshipped at Argos (Paus. ii. 20. § 4), Corinth, and Olympia(v. 15. § 3). In works of art the Horae were represented as blooming maidens, carrying the different products of the seasons.

     [Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples :] Horai (Horae, Seasons). That the gates of heaven are in charge of the Horai we may leave to the special knowledge and prerogative of Homer, for very likely he became an intimate of the Horai when he inherited the skies; but the subject that is here treated in the painting is easy for a man to understand. For the Horai (Seasons), coming to earth in their own proper forms, with clasped hands are dancing the year through its course, I think, and Ge (Gaea, the Earth) in her wisdom brings forth for them all the fruits of the year.
     <br/>
     ‘Tread not on the hyacinth or the rose’ I shall not say to the Horai of the spring-time; for when trodden on they seem sweeter and exhale a sweeter fragrance than the Horai themselves.
     <br/>
     ‘Walk not on the ploughed fields when soft’ I shall not say to the Horae of the winter-time; for if they are trodden on by the Horai they will produce ear of grain. And the golden-haired Horae yonder are walking on the spikes of the ears, but not so as to break or bend them; nay, they are so light that they do not even sway the stalks.
     <br/>
     It is charming of you, grape-vines, that ye try to lay hold of the Horai of autumn-tide; for you doubtless love the Horae because they make you fair and wine-sweet.
     <br/>
     Now these are our harvestings, so to speak, form the painting; but as for the Horai themselves, they are very charming and of marvelous art. How they sing, and how they whirl in the dance! Note too the fact that the back of none of them is turned to us; and note the raised arm, the freedom of flying hair, the cheek warm from the running, and the eyes that join in the dance. Perhaps they permit us to weave a tale about the painter; for it seems to me that he, falling in with the Horai as they danced, were caught up by them into their dance, the goddesses perhaps thus intimating that grace (
     <em>
      hora

      Nonnus, Dionysiaca 11. 486 - 12. 116 ff (trans. Rouse) (Greek epic C5th A.D.) :

     <br/>
     "The rosycheek Horai (Horae, Seasons), daughters of the restless lichtgang their stormfoot father [Helios], made a hast to the house of Helios (the Sun). One [Winter] wore a snowy veil shadowing her face, and sent forth a gleam of subtle light through the black clouds; her feet were fitted with chilly hailstone shoes. She had bound her braids about her watery head, and fastened across her brow a rain-producing veil, with an evergreen garland on her head and a white circlet of snow covering her frost-rimed breast.
     <br/>
     Another [Spring] puffed out from her lips the swallow-wind's breath which gives joy to mortal men, having banded the spring-time tresses of her zephyrloving head with a fresh dewy coronet, while she laughed like a flower, and fanned through her robe far abroad the fragrance of the opening rose at dawn. So she wove the merry dance for Adonis [whose festival was in spring] and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite] together.
     <br/>
     Another [Summer], the harvest-home Season (Hora), came with her Sisters. In her right hand she held a head of corn with grains clustering on the top, and a sickle with sharpcutting blade, forecrier of harvest; her maiden form was wrapt in linen shining white, and as she wheeled the dance the fine texture showed the secrets of her thighs, while in a hotter sun the cheeks of her drooping face were damp with dewy sweat.
     <br/>
     Another [Autumn] leading the dance for an easy plowing, had bound about her hairless temple shoots of olive drenches with the waters of sevenstream Nile. Scanty and withering was the hair by her temples, dry was her body; for she is fruitpining Autumn who shears off the foliage from the trees with scatter-leaf winds. For there were no vinebranches yet, trailing about the Nymphe's neck with tangled clusters and golden curls; not yet was she drunken with purple Maronian juice beside the neatswilling winepress; not yet had the ivy run up with wild intertwining tendrils. But then the fated time had come, which had brought the Horai (Horae, Seasons) running together to the house of Helios (the Sun).
     <br/>
     So these by the brows of western Okeanos (Oceanus) took ship for the mansion of Helios their father. As they approached, Hesperos (Hesperus) the Evening Star leapt up and went out of the hall to meet them. Selene (the Moon) herself also darted out newrisen, showing her light as she drove her cattle.
     <br/>
     The Sisters at the sight of the lifegiving Charioteer stayed their fruitful step. He had just finished his course and come down from the sky. Bright Phosphoros [the Morning Star] was ready for the fire-eyed driver, near his chariot and four. He put away the hot yokestraps and starry whip, and washed in the neighbouring Okeanos (Oceanus) stream the bodies of the firefed horses wet with sweat. The colts shook the dripping manes on their necks, and stamped with sparkling hooves the shining mangertrough. The four were greeted by the twelve circling Horai (Horae, Hours), daughters of Khronos (Chronos, Time), tripling round the fiery throne of the untiring Charioteer in a ring, servants of Helios that attend on his shining car, priestesses of the lichtgang each in her turn: for they bend the servile neck to the ancient manager o the universe.
     <br/>
     Then up and spoke the grapetending Hora (Season) [i.e. Autumn], holding out her hook of the fruitpining autumn as witness to her prayer: ‘Helios, giver of feason, plantdresser, lord of fruits! When will the soil make winemother grapes to grow? Which of the blessed will have this honour betrothed him by Aion (Aeon) [Khronos, Time]? Hide it not, I adjure you, because of all the Sisters I alone have no privilege of honour! I provide no fruit, no corn, no meadowhay, no rain from Zeus.’
     <br/>
     She spoke, and Helios cheered the nurse of the fruitage to come. He raised a finger, and pointed out to his circling daughter close to a wall opposite the separated tablets of Harmonia. In these are recorded in one group all the oracles which the prophetic hand of Phanes [Khronos, Time] first born engraved as ordained for the world, and drew with his pencil the house proper for each [the astronomical house or zodiac sign]. And Hyperion [Helios the Sun], dispenser of fire, added these words: ‘In the third tablet, you shall know whence the fruitage of wine shall come--where is the Lion and the Virgin: in the fourth, who is the Prince of grapes--that is where Ganymedes draws the delicious nectar, and lifts cup in hand in the picture.’
     <br/>
     When the god had spoken, the wineloving maiden turned her eyes about, and ran to the place. Beside the oracular wall she saw the first tablet, old as the infinite past, containing all things in one: upon it was all that Ophion lord paramount had done, all that ancient Kronos accomplished . . .
     <br/>
     But when the stormfoot Hora, Phaethon's [Helios the Sun's] handmaid, had seen the fiery shining victory of Zeus at war and the hailstorm snowstorm conflict of Kronos (Cronus), she looked at the next tablet in its turn. There was shown how the pine was in labour of the human race . . . how Raincloud Zeus brought the waters up in mountainous seas on high and flooded all cities . . .
     <br/>
     When the priestess of lichtgang passed with nimble foot to the third tabled, the circling maiden stood gazing at the manifold oracles of the world's fate, in letters of flowing colour engraved with the artist's vermilion, all that elaborate story which the primeval mind had inscribed; and this was the prophecy that she read in the tablets : ‘[Various prophecies from the nymphe Io to Atalanta] . . .’
     <br/>
     The Hora passed restless over all these on one tablet, until she came to the place where fiery Helios had indicated the signs of prophecy to the wind-swept maiden. There was drawn the shining Lion, there the starry Virgin was depicted in mimic shape, holding a bunch of grapes, the summergrown flower of fruitage: there the daughter of Khronos (Chronos, Time) stayed her feet, and this is what she read : ‘Kissos (Cissus, Ivy), the lovely youth, shall creep into a plant, and he shall by the highflying ivy that entwines about the branches. From young Kalamos (Calamus) will spring a reed rising straight and bending to the breeze, a delicate sprout of the fruitful soil, to support the tame vine. Ampelos (Ampelus, Vine) shall change form into a plant and give his name to the fruit of the vine.’
     <br/>
     But when the harvest-home maiden had seen all these prophecies, she sought the place where hard by on the neighbouring wall was engraved the figure of Ganymedes pouring the nectar-juice into a golden cup. There was an oracle engraved in four lines of verse. There the grape-loving goddess revelled, for she found this prophecy, kept for Lyaios (Lyaeus) Ivybearer [Dionysos], ‘Zeus gave to Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] the prophetic laurel, red roses to the rosy Aphrodite, the grayleaf olive to Athena Greyeyes, corn to Demeter, vine to Dionysos.’
     <br/>
     That is what the Euian maiden saw on the tablets. She departed joyful, and with her Sisters was away to the stream of the eastern Okeanos (Oceanus), moving along with Phaethon's [Helios the Sun's] team."

     The Horai (HOrae) were close companions of the gods of spring, such as Hera queen of the heavens, Aphrodite the goddess of procreation (including animals in spring), Hermes god of the herds and flocks, and Persephone goddess of the spring growth. They were often depicted as nature's midwives, as were their sisters, the Moirai or Fates.
