   EOS - Greek Goddess of the Dawn (Roman Aurora)
  </title>
  <meta content="Eos was the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn. She rose into the sky from the river Oceanus at the start of each day, and with her rays of light dispersed the mists of night. Eos was depicted either driving a chariot drawn by winged horses or borne aloft on her own wings. Her Roman name was Aurora." name="description"/>

     EOS was the rosy-fingered goddess of the dawn. She and her siblings
     <a href="Helios.html">
      Helios
     </a>
     (the Sun) and
     <a href="Selene.html">
      Selene
     </a>
     (the Moon) were numbered amongst the second-generation
     <a href="Titanes.html">
      Titan
     </a>
     gods. Eos rose into the sky from the river
     <a href="TitanOkeanos.html">
      Okeanos
     </a>
     (Oceanus) at the start of each day, and with her rays of light dispersed the mists of night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was depicted either driving a chariot drawn by winged horses or borne aloft on her own wings.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eos had an unquenchable desire for handsome young men, some say as the result of a curse laid upon her by the goddess
     <a href="../Olympios/Aphrodite.html">
      Aphrodite
     </a>
     . Her lovers included
     <a href="../Gigante/GiganteOrion.html">
      Orion
     </a>
     ,
     <a href="AsterPhaethon.html">
      Phaethon
     </a>
     , Kephalos (Cephalus) and Tithonos (Tithonus), three of which she ravished away to distant lands. The Trojan prince Tithonos became her official consort. When the goddess petitioned
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     for his immortality, she neglected also to request eternal youth. In time he shrivelled up by old age and transformed into a grasshopper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eos was closely identified with
     <a href="../Protogenos/Hemera.html">
      Hemera
     </a>
     , the primordial goddess of day. In some myths--such as the tales of Orion and Kephalos--Eos stood virtually as a non-virginal substitute for
     <a href="../Olympios/Artemis.html">
      Artemis

     .

     EOS (Êôs), in Latin
     <em>
      Aurora,
     </em>
     the goddess of the morning red, who brings up the light of day from the east. She was a daughter of Hyperion and Theia or Euryphassa, and a sister of Helios and Selene. (Hes.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     371, &amp;c.; Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn in Sol.
     </em>
     ii.) Ovid (
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ix. 420,
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     iv. 373) calls her a daughter of Pallas. At the close of night she rose front the couch of her beloved Tithonus, and on a chariot drawn by the swift horses Lampus and Phaëton she ascended up to heaven from the river Oceanus, to announce the coming light of the sun to the gods as well as to mortals. (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     v. 1, &amp;c., xxiii. 244; Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 129,
     <em>
      Georg.
     </em>
     i. 446; Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn in Merc.
     </em>
     185; Theocrit. ii. 148, xiii. 11.) In the Homeric poems Eos not only announces the coming Helios, but accompanies him throughout the day, and her career is not complete till the evening; hence she is sometimes mentioned where one would have expected Helios (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     v. 390, x. 144); and the tragic writers completely identify her with Hemera, of whom in later times the same myths are related as of Eos. (Paus. i. 3. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.) The later Greek and the Roman poets followed, on the whole, the notions of Eos, which Homer had established, and the splendour of a southern aurora, which lasts much longer than in our climate, is a favourite topic with the ancient poets. Mythology represents her as having carried off several youths distinguished for their beauty. Thus she carried away Orion, but the gods were angry at her for it, until Artemis with a gentle arrow killed him. (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     v. 121.) According to Apollodorus (i. 4. § 4) Eos carried Orion to Delos, and was ever stimulated by Aphrodite. Cleitus, the son of Mantius, was carried by Eos to the seats of the immortal gods (
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xv. 250), and Tithonus, by whom she became the mother of Emathion and Memnon, was obtained in like manner. She begged of Zeus to make him immortal, but forgot to request him to add eternal youth. So long as he was young and beautiful, she lived with him at the end of the earth, on the banks of Oceanus ; and when he grew old, she nursed him, until at length his voice disappeared and his body became quite dry. She then locked the body up in her chamber, or metamorphosed it into a cricket. (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn. in Ven.
     </em>
     218, &amp;c.; Horat.
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     i. 22. 8, ii. 16. 30; Apollod. iii. 12. § 4; Hes.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     984; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Georg.
     </em>
     i. 447, iii. 328,
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     iv. 585.) When her son Memnon was going to fight against Achilles, she asked Hephaestus to give her arms for him, and when Memnon was killed, her tears fell down in the form of morning dew. (Virg.
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     viii. 384.) By Astraeus Eos became the mother of Zephyrus, Boreas, Notus, Heosphorus, and the other stars. (Hesiod.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     378.) Cephalus was carried away by her from the summit of mount Hymetttus to Syria, and by him she became the mother of Phaëton or Tithonus, the father of Phaëton; but afterwards she restored her beloved to his wife Procris. (Hes.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     984; Apollod. iii. 14. § 3; Paus. i. 3. § 1; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     vii. 703, &amp;c.; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab
     </em>
     189.) Eos was represented in the pediment of the kingly stoa at Athens in the act of carrying off Cephalus, and in the same manner she was seen on the throne of the Amyclaean Apollo. (Paus. i. 3. § 1, iii. 18. § 7.) At Olympia she was represented in the act of praying to Zeus for Memnon. (v. 22. 2.) In the works of art still extant, she appears as a winged goddess or in a chariot drawn by four horses.

     "When Cephalus, who was fond of hunting, had gone to the mountain in the early morning, Aurora [Eos], wife of Tithonus, fell passionately in love with him, and begged for his embrace. He refused, since he had given his promise to Procris. Then Aurora said : ‘I don't want you to break faith, unless she has done so before you.’ And so she changed his form into that of a stranger, and gave him beautiful gifts to give to Procris. When Cephalus had come in his changed form, he gave the gifts to Procris and lay with her. Then Aurora took away his new appearance. When Procris saw Cephalus, she knew she had been deceived by Aurora, and fled to the island of Crete . . .
     <br/>
     [Procris was eventually reunited with Cephalus] nevertheless out of fear of Aurora she followed him to watch him in the early morning, and hid among the bushes. When Cephalus saw the bushes stir, he hurled the unavoidable javelin, and killed his wife."

     <br/>
     "Within two months after our [Kephalos (Cephalus) and Prokris' (Procris')] marriage, while I [Kephalos] spread my nets to catch the antlered deer, the saffron Aurora [Eos the Dawn], above Hymettus' ever-flowery peak, saw me at daybreak as the twilight fled, and carried me away against my will. And may the goddess pardon me, if I say what is true : her rosy cheeks are fair, she rules the borderlands of dark and day, she drinks the nectar's honeydew, but I loved Procris, Procris ever in my heart, and Procris on my lips. I spoke of bonds of holy wedlock, of love's fresh delights, my vows so new and my deserted bride, until in rage the goddess cried : ‘Enough of your complaining! Have your Procris! But, if I can see the future, you will rue the day you had her,’ and so sent me back. On my way home the goddess' prophecy began to form, fear that my wife had failed her marriage vows . . . Intent on heartbreak I resolved to test her loyalty with presents. And Aurora [Eos] favoured my fears and changed my form and face (If felt the change) and so I entered Athens unrecognisable and made my way back home . . . [and attempted to seduce his wife in the form of another man. Prokris failed the test and fled him, but the two were eventually reconciled.]
     <br/>
     I would go hunting when the sun's first beams coloured the hilltops, as a young man will, roving the woods alone . . . and when my hand had had its fill of sport I used to seek the coolness of the shade and of the breeze, the
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     breathing from the chilly dales. I sought the gentle
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     in the heat, I waited for the
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     , for its balm, my labour's rest. ‘Come,
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     ,’ I would call, how I remember! ‘soothe me, welcome guest, come to my breast, relieve, as is your way, the heat with which I burn.’ And I might add, so my fate led me on, more blandishments. ‘You comfort and refresh me. For your sake I love the lonely places and the woods; your breath I seek for ever on my lips.’
     <br/>
     Some fool who overheard my words mistook the double sense and thought that
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     (breeze) called so often was the goddess [Aurora, Eos the Dawn], and I in love. This hasty tell-tale hurried off to Procris and told in whispers my supposed offence. Love will believe too soon. In sudden grief she swooned, they told me, then, restored at last, bemoaned her misery, her cruel fate, accused my honour and, imagining a false offence, feared a mere nothing, feared an insubstantial name, poor soul, and grieved as over a true rival paramour. Yet she had doubts and in her wretchedness hoped she was wrong, refusing to accept the tale or, till her eyes had evidence convict her husband of such villainy.
     <br/>
     Next day the gleam of dawn had banished night and out into the woods I went and found good sport and, lying on the grass, I called ‘Come,
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     (breeze), come and soothe my weariness! And suddenly, as I spoke, I seemed to hear a sound of moaning, but I called again ‘Come, best and loveliest!’ A falling leaf made a slight rustle and I thought it was some lurking beast and hurled my [magic never-failing] javelin. It was my wife! Clutching her wounded breast, ‘Ay me! Ay me!’ she cried. I knew her voice, my Procris' voice, and like a madman rushed headlong towards the sound. And there, half-dead, her clothes blood-splattered, plucking from the wound the gift (heaven help me!) she had given me, I found her . . .
     <br/>
     Exhausted then and dying, these few words she forced herself to murmur : ‘By our vows of wedlock, by the gods of home and heaven, by my deserts, if I have well deserved, by my death's cause, my own still-living love, I beg you, I implore you, not to take Aura [that is, Aurora or Eos] to be your wife in place of my.’ And then at last I learnt of her mistake and told her all. But what did telling help? She slipped away; what little strength was left ebbed with her failing blood; and while her eyes had power still to gaze, she gazed at me, and on my lips her life's last breath was spent; but she looked glad and seemed to die content."
     <br/>
     [N.B. "
     <em>
      aura
     </em>
     " was also the Greek word for breeze. Presumably the Greeks also applied it to Eos mother of the winds.]

Therefore not from thee nor from grim battle shrink I, knowing well how far my goddess-mother doth transcend a Nereis (Nereid), whose child thou vauntest thee.

     "[Akhilleus (Achilles) and Memnon engage in battle  :] But when long lengthened out the conflict was of those two champions, and the might of both in that strong tug and strain was equal-matched, then, gazing from Olympos' far-off heights, the Gods joyed, some in the invincible son of Peleus, others in the goodly child of old Tithonos (Tithonus) and Eos (the Queen of Dawn). Thundered the heavens on high from east to west . . . and trembled for her son Erigeneia (the Child of the Mist) as in her chariot through the sky she rode. Marvelled the Daughters of the Sun [Horai, Horae] who stood near her, around that wondrous splendour-ring traced for the race-course of the tireless sun by Zeus, the limit of all Nature's life and death, the dally round that maketh up the eternal circuit of the rolling years. And now amongst the Blessed bitter feud had broken out; but by behest of Zeus the twin Keres (Fates) suddenly stood beside these twain, one dark--her shadow fell on Memnon's heart; one bright--her radiance haloed Peleus' son [Akhilleus]. And with a great cry the Immortals saw, and filled with sorrow they of the one part were, they of the other with triumphant joy."

     <br/>
     "[Akhilleus (Achilles) slays Memnon with his sword  :] Then groaned Eos (Dawn), and palled herself in clouds, and earth was darkened. At their mother's hest all the light Aetai (Winds) [Anemoi] took hands, and slid down one long stream of sighing wind to Priamos' (Priam's) plain, and floated round the dead, and softly, swiftly caught they up, and bare through silver mists Eos' (the Dawn's) son, with hearts sore aching for their brother's fall, while moaned around them all the air. As on they passed, fell many blood-gouts from those pierced limbs down to the earth, and these were made a sign to generations yet to be. The Gods gathered them up from many lands, and made thereof a far-resounding river, named of all that dwell beneath long Ida's flanks Paphlagoneion. As its waters flow twixt fertile acres, once a year they turn to blood, when comes the woeful day whereon died Memnon. Thence a sick and choking reek steams : thou wouldst say that from a wound unhealed corrupting humours breathed an evil stench. Ay, so the Gods ordained : but now flew on bearing Eos' mighty son the rushing Aetai (Winds) skimming earth's face and palled about with night.
     <br/>
     Nor were his Aithiopian (Ethiopian) comrades left to wander of their King forlorn : a God [Eos] suddenly winged those eager souls with speed such as should soon be theirs for ever, changed to flying fowl, the children of the air. Wailing their King in the winds' track they sped . . . so they left far behind that stricken field of blood, and fast they followed after those swift Aetai (Winds) with multitudinous moaning, veiled in mist unearthly. Trojans over all the plain and Danaans marvelled, seeing that great host vanishing with their King. All hearts stood still in dumb amazement. But the tireless Aetai (Winds) sighing set hero Memnon's giant corpse down by the deep flow of Aisepos' (Aesepus') stream, where is a fair grove of the bright-haired Nymphai (Nymphs), the which round his long barrow afterward Aisepos' daughters planted, screening it with many and manifold trees: and long and loud wailed those Immortals, chanting his renown, the son of Erigeneia (the Dawn-goddess) splendour-throned.
     <br/>
     Now sank the sun: Eos (the Lady of the Morn) wailing her dear child from the heavens came down. Twelve maidens [the twelve Horai, Hours] shining-tressed attended her, the warders of the high paths of the sun for ever circling, warders of the night and dawn . . . These came down from heaven, for Memnon wailing wild and high; and mourned with these the Pleiades [star-nymphs]. Echoed round far-stretching mountains, and Aisepos' stream. Ceaseless uprose the keen, and in their midst, fallen on her son and clasping, wailed Eos; ‘Dead art thou, dear, dear child, and thou hast clad thy mother with a pall of grief. Oh, I, now thou art slain, will not endure to light the Immortal Heavenly Ones! No, I will plunge down to the dread depths of the underworld, where thy lone spirit flitteth to and fro, and will to blind night leave earth, sky, and sea, till Khaeos (Chaos) and formless darkness brood o'er all, that Kronos' (Cronus') son [Zeus] may also learn what means anguish of heart. For not less worship-worthy than Nereos' (Nereus') Child, by Zeus's ordinance, am I, who look on all things, I, who bring all to their consummation. Recklessly my light Zeus now despiseth! Therefore I will pass into the darkness. Let him bring up to Olympos Thetis from the sea to hold for him light forth to Gods and men! 
  My sad soul loveth darkness more than day, lest I pour light upon thy slayer's head.’
     <br/>
     Thus as she cried, the tears ran down her face immortal, like a river brimming aye : drenched was the dark earth round the corse. Nyx (the Night) grieved in her daughter's anguish, and the heaven drew over all his stars a veil of mist and cloud, of love unto Erigeneia (the Lady of Light). 
  All night in groans and sighs most pitiful Eos (the Dawn-queen) lay: a sea of darkness moaned around her. Of the dayspring nought she recked: she loathed Olympos' spaces. At her side fretted and whinnied still her fleetfoot steeds, trampling the strange earth, gazing at their Queen grief-stricken, yearning for the fiery course. Suddenly crashed the thunder of the wrath of Zeus; rocked round her all the shuddering earth, and on immortal Eos trembling came.
     <br/>
     Swiftly the dark-skinned Aethiopes (Ethiopians) from her sight buried their lord lamenting. As they wailed unceasingly, Erigeneia (the Dawn-queen) lovely-eyed changed them to birds sweeping through air around the barrow of the mighty dead. And these still do the tribes of men ‘The Memnones’ call; and still with wailing cries they dart and wheel above their king's tomb, and they scatter dust down on his grave, still shrill the battle-cry, in memory of Memnon, each to each. But he in Haides' mansions, or perchance amid the Blessed on the Elysian Plain, laugheth. Divine Eos comforteth her heart beholding them : but theirs is toil of strife unending, till the weary victors strike the vanquished dead, or one and all fill up the measure of their doom around his grave.
     <br/>
     So by command of Erigeneia (Lady of Light) the swift birds dree their weird. But Eos (Dawn) divine now heavenward soared with the all-fostering Horai (Hours), who drew her to Zeus' threshold, sorely loth, yet conquered by their gentle pleadings, such as salve the bitterest grief of broken hearts. Nor Eos (the Dawn-queen) forgat her daily course, but quailed before the unbending threat of Zeus, of whom are all things, even all comprised within the encircling sweep of Okeanos' (Oceanus') stream, Earth and the palace-dome of burning stars. Before her went her Pleiades-harbingers, then she herself flung wide the ethereal gates, and, scattering spray of splendour, flashed there-through."

     "[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] This is the army of Memnon; their arms have been laid aside, and they are laying out the body of their chief for mourning; he has been struck in the breast, I think, by the ashen spear . . . it is Memnon, the son of Eos (the Dawn), who is being mourned. When he came to the defence of Troy, [Akhilleus (Achilles)] the son of Peleus, they say, slew him, mighty though he was and likely to be no whit inferior to his opponent. Notice to what huge length he lies on the ground, and how long is the crop of curls . . . You would not say that Memnon's skin is really black, for the black of it shows a trace of ruddiness.
     <br/>
     As for the deities of the sky (
     <em>
      daimones meteôroi
     </em>
     ), Eos (the Dawn) mourning over her son causes Helios (the Sun) to be downcast and begs Nyx (Night) to come prematurely and check the hostile army, that she may be able to steal away her son, no doubt with the consent of Zeus. And look! Memnon has been stolen away and is at the edge of the painting. Where is he? In what part of the earth? No tomb of Memnon is anywhere to be seen but in Aithiopia (Ethiopia) he himself has been transformed into a statue of black marble [i.e. a colossal statue on the upper Nile, still extant]. The attitude is that of a seated person, but he figure is that of Memnon yonder, if I mistake not, and the ray of Helios (the Sun) falls on the statue. For Helios (the Sun), striking the lips of Memnon as a plectrum strikes the lyre, seems to summon a voice from them, and by this speech-producing artifice consoles Hemera (the Day) [i.e. Eos]."

There was in Aithiopia (Ethiopia) an image of Memnon, the son of Tithonos (Tithonus), made of marble . . .  but stone though it was it had the power of speech. For at one time it saluted rising Hemera (Day) [i.e. Eos], by its voice giving token of its joy and expressing delight at the arrival of its mother; and again, as day declined to night, it uttered piteous and mournful groans in grief at her departure. Nor yet was the marble at a loss for tears, but they too were at hand to serve its will . . . The statue in question both lulled to rest the sorrows of Hemera (Day) and caused her to abandon her search for her son, as though the art of the Aithiopes (Ethiopians) were compensating her by means of the statue for the Memnon who had been snatched away from her by fate."

     "Aurora [Eos], who had favoured Troy's arms too . . . a closer trouble, a family grief, had wrung her heart, the loss of Memnon. Slaughtered by Achilles' spear, she, his bright golden mother, saw him dead upon the plain of Troy. The rosy blush that dyes the hour of dawn grew pale and clouds hid the bright heavens. But when his limbs were laid on the last flames, she could not bear to look. With hair unbound, just as she was, she knelt (nor did her pride disdain) before the knees of mighty Jove [Zeus] and pleaded through her tears : ‘Least I may be of all the goddesses the golden heavens hold (in all the world my shrines are rarest), yet a deity I am, and I have come not for a gift of fanes or altar-fires or holy days; though should you see how great the services I, but a woman, give when I preserve at each new dawn the boundaries of night, you'd judge some guerdon due. But it's not now Aurora's [Eos'] errand nor her care to claim honours well-earned. I come because my son, Memnon, is lost, who for his uncle's [King Priamos (Priam) of Troy's] sake in vain bore valiant arms and in his first youth (so you willed it) fell to brave Achilles. Grant him, I pray, Ruler of Heaven most high, some honour, solace that he had to die, and soothe a wounded mother's misery!’
     <br/>
     Juppiter [Zeus] nodded his assent as Memnon's pyre fell to the leaping flames. Black rolling smoke darkened the daylight, as a stream breathes forth the mist it breeds that lets no sunlight through. Up flew black ashes, and they clustered thick into a single mass, which took a shape and from the fire drew heat and breath of life. Its lightness gave it wings and like a bird at first, and presently a real bird, its great wings whirred and with it sister-birds whirred beyond counting, all from the same source. Three times they circled round the pyre; three times their cries, united, echoed through the air. One the fourth flight the flock split up; then two fierce legions, so divided, fought each other with claws and beaks in full fury, till their wings and battling breasts were weary; then they fell, death-offerings, on the ash whose kin they were, recalling that brave soul from whom they sprang. He who begot them gave those sudden birds their name ‘Memnonides’ ; and when the sun has coursed through the twelve signs, they fight again to die in memory of Memnon slain . . . Aurora intent on her own grief : now still her loving sorrow she renews and with her tears the whole wide world bedews."
