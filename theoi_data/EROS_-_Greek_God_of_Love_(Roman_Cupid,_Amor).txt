   EROS - Greek God of Love (Roman Cupid, Amor)
  </title>
  <meta content="Eros was the mischievous ancient Greek god of love, a minion and constant companion of the goddess Aphrodite. He lit the flame of love in the hearts of the gods and men, armed with either a bow and arrows or a flaming torch. Eros was depicted as either a handsome youth or child. His attributes were varied--from the usual bow and arrows, to the gifts of a lover such as a hare, sash, or flower. His Roman name was Cupid." name="description"/>

     EROS was the mischievous god of love, a minion and constant companion of the goddess
     <a href="../Olympios/Aphrodite.html">
      Aphrodite
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     The poet Hesiod first represents him as a primordial deity who emerges self-born at the beginning of time to spur procreation. (See the
     <a href="../Protogenos/Eros.html">
      Protogenos Eros
     </a>
     and
     <a href="../Protogenos/Phanes.html">
      Phanes
     </a>
     for more information.) 
  The same poet later describes two love-gods, Eros and
     <a href="ErosHimeros.html">
      Himeros
     </a>
     (Desire), accompanying Aphrodite at the time of her birth from the sea-foam. Some classical writers interpreted this to mean the pair were born of the goddess immediately following her birth or else alongside her from the sea-foam. The scene was particular popular in ancient art where the godlings flutter about the goddess as she reclines inside a conch-shell.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually Eros was multiplied by ancient poets and artists into a host of
     <a href="Erotes.html">
      Erotes
     </a>
     (Roman Cupides). 
  The singular Eros, however, remained distinct in myth. It was he who lit the flame of love in the hearts of the gods and men, armed with either a bow and arrows or a flaming torch. Eros was often portrayed as the disobedient but fiercely loyal child of Aphrodite.
    </p>
    <p>
     In ancient vase painting Eros is depicted as either a handsome youth or child. His attributes were varied--from the usual bow and arrows, to the gifts of a lover such as a hare, sash, or flower. Sculptors preferred the image of the bow-armed boy, whereas mosaic artists favoured the figure of a winged
     <em>
      putto
     </em>
     (plump baby).

     ENCYCLOPEDIA
    </h2>
    <p>
     EROS (Erôs), in Latin, AMOR or CUPI′DO, the god of love. In the sense in which he is usually conceived, Eros is the creature of the later Greek poets; and in order to understand the ancients properly we must distinguish three Erotes: viz. the Eros of the ancient cosmogonies, the Eros of the philosophers and mysteries, who bears great resemblance to the first, and the Eros whom we meet with in the epigrammatic and erotic poets, whose witty and playful descriptions of the god, however, can scarcely be considered as a part of the ancient religious belief of the Greeks. Homer does not mention Eros, and Hesiod, the earliest author that mentions him, describes him as the cosmogonic Eros. First, says Hesiod (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     120, &amp;c.), there was Chaos, then came Ge, Tartarus, and Eros, the fairest among the gods, who rules over the minds and the council of gods and men. In this account we already perceive a combination of the most ancient with later notions.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to the former, Eros was one of the fundamental causes in the formation of the world, inasmuch as he was the uniting power of love, which brought order and harmony among the conflicting elements of which Chaos consisted. In the same metaphysical sense he is conceived by Aristotle (
     <em>
      Metaph.
     </em>
     i. 4); and similarly in the Orphic poetry (Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     5; comp. Aristoph.
     <em>
      Av.
     </em>
     695) he is described as the first of the gods, who sprang from the world's egg. In Plato's Symposium (p. 178,b) he is likewise called the oldest of the gods. It is quite in accordance with the notion of the cosmogonic Eros, that he is described as a son of Cronos and Ge, of Eileithyia, or as a god who had no parentage, and came into existence by himself. (Paus. ix. c. 27.) The Eros of later poets, on the other hand, who gave rise to that notion of the god which is most familiar to us, is one of the youngest of all the gods. (Paus.
     <em>
      l. c. ;
     </em>
     Cic.
     <em>
      de Nat. Deor.
     </em>
     iii. 23.) The parentage of the second Eros is very differently described, for he is called a son of Aphrodite (either Aphrodite Urania or Aphrodite Pandemos), or Polymnia, or a son of Porus and Penia, who was begotten on Aphrodite's birthday. (Plat.
     <em>
      l. c. ;
     </em>
     Sext. Emp.
     <em>
      adv. Math.
     </em>
     i. 540.) According to other genealogies, again, Eros was a son of Hermes by Artemis or Aphrodite, or of Ares by Aphrodite (Cic.
     <em>
      de Nat. Deor.
     </em>
     iii. 23), or of Zephyrus and Iris (Plut.
     <em>
      Amal.
     </em>
     20; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 555), or, lastly, a son of Zeus by his own daughter Aphrodite, so that Zeus was at once his father and grandfather. (Virg.
     <em>
      Cir.
     </em>
     134.) Eros in this stage is always conceived and was always represented as a handsome youth, and it is not till about after the time of Alexander the Great that Eros is represented by the epigrammatists and the erotic poets as a wanton boy, of whom a thousand tricks and cruel sports are related, and from whom neither gods nor men were safe. He is generally described as a son of Aphrodite; but as love finds its way into the hearts of men in a manner which no one knows, the poets sometimes describe him as of unknown origin (Theocrit. xiii. 2), or they say that he had indeed a mother, but not a father. (Meleagr.
     <em>
      Epigr.
     </em>
     50.) In this stage Eros has nothing to do with uniting the discordant elements of the universe, or the higher sympathy or love which binds human kind together; but he is purely the god of sensual love, who bears sway over the inhabitants of Olympus as well as over men and all living creatures: he tames lions and tigers, breaks the thunderbolts of Zeus, deprives Heracles of his arms, and carries on his sport with the monsters of the sea. (Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     57 ; Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     x. 29; Mosch.
     <em>
      Idyll.
     </em>
     vi. 10; Theocrit. iii. 15.) His arms, consisting of arrows, which he carries in a golden quiver, and of torches, no one can touch with impunity. (Mosch.
     <em>
      Idyll.
     </em>
     vi.; Theocrit. xxiii. 4; Ov.
     <em>
      Trist.
     </em>
     v. 1, 22.) His arrows are of different power: some are golden, and kindle love in the heart they wound; others are blunt and heavy with lead, and produce aversion to a lover. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 468; Eurip.
     <em>
      Iphig. Aul.
     </em>
     548.) Eros is further represented with golden wings, and as fluttering about like a bird. (Comp. Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 987.) His eyes are sometimes covered, so that he acts blindly. (Theocrit. x. 20.) He is the usual companion of his mother Aphrodite, and poets and artists represent him, moreover, as accompanied by such allegorical beings as Pothos, Himeros, Dionysus, Tyche, Peitho, the Charites or Muses. (Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     i. 41; Anacr. xxxiii. 8; Hesiod,
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     201; Paus. vi. 24. § 5, vii. 26. § 3, i. 43. §6.) His statue and that of Hermes usually stood in the Greek gymnasia. (Athen. xiii. p. 551; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1596.)
    </p>
    <p>
     We must especially notice the connexion of Eros with Anteros, with which persons usually connect the notion of "Love returned." But originally Anteros was a being opposed to Eros, and fighting against him. (Paus. i. 30. § 1, vi. 23. § 4.) This conflict, however, was also conceived as the rivalry existing between two lovers, and Anteros accordingly punished those who did not return the love of others; so that he is the avenging Eros, or a
     <em>
      deus ultor.
     </em>
     (Paus. i. 30. § 1;
     <em>
      Ov. Met.
     </em>
     xiii. 750, &amp;c.; Plat.
     <em>
      Phaedr.
     </em>
     p. 255, d.) The number of Erotes (Amores and Cupidines) is playfully extended ad libitum by later poets, and these Erotes are described either as sons of Aphrodite or of nymphs. Among the places distinguished for their worship of Eros, Thespiae in Boeotia stands foremost: there his worship was very ancient, and the old representation of the god was a rude stone (Paus. ix. 27. § 1), to which in later times, however, the most exquisite works of art were added. (Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 266.) At Thespiae a quinquennial festival, the Erotidia or Erotia, were celebrated in honour of the god. (Paus.
     <em>
      l. c.;
     </em>
     Athen. xiii. p. 561.) Besides Sparta, Samos, and Parion on the Hellespont, he was also worshipped at Athens, where he had an altar at the entrance of the Academy. (Paus. i. 30. § 1.) At Megara his statue, together with those of Himeros and Pothos, stood in the temple of Aphrodite. (Paus. i. 43. § 6, comp. iii. 26. § 3, vi. 24. § 5, vii. 26. § 3.) Among the things sacred to Eros, and which frequently appear with him in works of art, we may mention the rose, wild beasts which are tamed by him, the hare, the cock, and the ram. Eros was a favourite subject with the ancient statuaries, but his representation seems to have been brought to perfection by Praxiteles, who conceived him as a full-grown youth of the most perfect beauty. (Lucian,
     <em>
      Am.
     </em>
     ii. 17; Plin.
     <em>
      H. N.
     </em>
     xxxvi. 4, 5.) In later times artists followed the example of poets, and represented him as a little boy.

Later than Olen, both Pamphos and Orpheus [legendary Greek poets] wrote hexameter verse, and composed poems on Eros, in order that they might be among those sung by the Lykomidai (Lycomidae) to accompany the ritual. I read them after conversation with a Torchbearer. Of these things I will make no further mention. Hesiod, or he who wrote the Theogony fathered on Hesiod, writes, I know, that Khaos (Chaos) was born first, and after Khaos, Ge (Gaea, Earth), Tartaros (Tartarus) and Eros. Sappho of Lesbos wrote many poems about Eros, but they are not consistent.”

Thus quickly Eros leapt into his mother's gleaming arms, and pounced at once upon her firm breasts spreading himself over that nursing bosom.

     When Eros had seen and handled each in turn, he put back the other fire-barbed shafts, and taking the fifth he fitted it to the shining bowstring; but first he put a sprig of ivy on the barb of the winged arrow, to be a fitting chaplet for the god of the vine, and dipt the whole shaft in a bowl of nectar, that Bakkhos (Bacchus) [Dionysos] might grow a nectarial vintage.

The bowstring sparkled over the flower-decked shaft, and as the bow was drawn stretched back the poet-missile sounded the Bacchic strain. Zeus was the butt--for all his greatness he bowed his neck to Eros the nobody! And like a shooting star the shaft of love flew spinning into the heart of Zeus, with a bridal whistle, but swerving with a calculated twist it had just scratched his rounded thigh with its grooves--a foretaste of the birth to come [i.e. the infant Dionysos would be recovered from the dead body of Semele and implanted in the thigh of Zeus]. Then Kronion (Cronion) quickly turned the eye which was the channel of desire and the love-charm flogged him into passion for the girl. At the sight of Semele he leapt up, in wonder."

The third part of the world's at stake, while we in heaven (so long-suffering!) are despised--my power grows less, and less the power of Amor [Eros]. Do you not see how Pallas [Athena] and Diana [Artemis], queen of the chase, have both deserted me?

She placed her own goldwrought throne beside the place where her son [Eros] sat, and throwing an arm round his waist, with quiet countenance opened her glad arms to receive the boy and held the dear burden on her knees; she kissed both his lips and eyes, touched his mind-bewitching bow and fingered the quiver, and spoke in feigned anger these cunning words : ‘You hope of all life! You cajoler of the Foamborn! . . . Come--for your sister's [Beroe's] beauty draw your bow and bewitch the gods, or say, shoot one shaft and hit with the same shot Poseidon and vinegod Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos], Blessed Ones both. I will give you a gift for your long shot which will be a proper wage worthy of your feat--I will give you the marriage harp of gold, which Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] gave to Harmonia at the door of the bridal chamber; I will place it in your hands in memory of a city to be, that you may be not only an archer, but a harpist, just like Apollon . . .’
     <br/>
     He [Eros] obeyed her request; treading on Time's heels hot Eros (Love) swiftly sped, plying his feet into the wind, high in the clouds scoring the air with winged step, and carried his flaming bow; the quiver too, filled with gentle fire, hung down over his shoulder. As when a star stretches straight with a long trail of sparks . . . so went furious Eros in a swift rush, and his wings beat the air with a sharp whirring sound that whistled down from the sky. Then near the Assyrian rock he united from fiery arrows on one string, to bring two wooers into like desire for the love of a maid [Beroe], rivals for one bride, the vinegod [Dionysos] and the ruler of the sea [Poseidon] . . . 
  One came from the deep waters of the sea-neighbouring roadstead, and one left the land of Tyre, and among the mountains of Lebanon the two met in one place . . .

     Then Eros came quickly up to the maiden hard by, and struck both divinities with two arrows. He maddened Dionysos to offer his treasures to the bride, life's merry heart and the ruddy vintage of the grape; he goaded to love the lord of the trident, that he might bring the sea-neighbouring maid a double lovegift, seafaring battle on the water and varied dishes for the table. He set Bakkhos (Bacchus) more in a flame, since wine excites the mind for desire, and wine finds unbridled youth much more obedient to the rein when it is charmed with the prick of unreason; so he shot Bakkhos and drove the whole shaft into his heart, and Bakkhos burnt, as much as he was charmed by the trickling honey of persuasion. Thus he maddened them both; and in the counterfeit shape of a bird circling his tracks in the airy road as swift as the rapid winds, he rose with paddling feet, and cried these taunting words : ‘If Dionysos confounds men with wine, I excite Bakkhos with fire!’"

Beroe was no proper bride for Bakkhos (Bacchus), but his marriage of the sea was quite fitting, because I joined the daughter of Aphrodite of the sea to a husband whose path is in the sea.

Wrestling was to win the bride : Peitho clad her delicate body in a silvery robe, foretelling victory for Lyaios's (Lyaeus') wooing . . .

But Eros went on killing the beasts, until he was weary of the bowstring and hitting the grim face of a panther or the snout of a bear; then he caught a lioness alive with the allbewitching cestus, and dragged the beast away showed her fettered to his merry mother. The maiden saw in the darkness how mischievious Eros teased herself also as he leaned her arm on Kythereia (Cytherea) and Adonis, while he made his prey the proud lioness, bend a slavish knee before Aphrodite, as he cried loudly, ‘Garlanded mother of the Erotes (Loves)! I lead to you Aura, the maiden too fond of maidenhood, and she bows her neck. Now you dancers of lovestricken Orkhomenos (Orchomenus) [the Kharites (Charites)], crown this cestus, the strap that waists on marriage, because it has conquered the stubborn will of this invincible lioness!’

     Such was the prophetic oracle which Aura the mountain maiden saw. Nor was it vain for the loves, since they themselves bring a man in to the net and hunt a woman.

     VII. THE LOVE OF MORRHEUS &amp; CHALCOMEDE
    </h4>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-greek">
      Nonnus, Dionysiaca 33. 4 ff :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[During Dionysos' war with the Indians, Eros causes the Indian warrior Morrheus to fall in love with Khalkomedeia (Chalcomedea), and so assists the god.]
     <br/>
     [Aphrodite addresses the Kharis (Charis) Pasithea :] ‘Dear girl, what trouble has changed your looks? . . . Are you plagued by my son [Eros god of love], perhaps? Are you in love with some herdsman, among the mountains, struck with desire, like Selene (Goddess of the Moon)? Has Eros perhaps flicked you also with the cestus, like Eos (the Dawn) once before? . . .’
     <br/>
     When Aphrodite had said this, the Kharis weeping replied : ‘O mother of the Erotes (Loves)! O sower of life in the everlasting universe . . . I am tormented by the afflictions of Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos] my father, driven about in terror by the Erinyes (Fury). He is your brother - protect Dionysos if you can! . . .’
     <br/>
     Then sweetsmiling Aphrodite put off the wonted laugh from her radiant rosy face, and told her messenger Aglaia (Aglaea) [one of the Kharites (Charites)] to call Eros her son, that swift airy flyer, that guide to the fruitful increase of the human race.
     <br/>
     The Kharis moved her footsteps, and turned her face this way over earth and sea and sky, if somewhere she might find the restless track of Eros--for he beats his wings everywhere circling the four separate regions of the universe [perhaps earth, sea, sky and underworld].
     <br/>
     She found him on the golden top of Olympos, shooting the nectar-drops from a cup [playing cottabus and game in which wine was thrown out of cups at a mark]. Beside him stood Hymenaios (Hymenaeus), his fair-haired playfellow in the dainty game . . . [See Eros &amp; his Playmate Hymenaeus on the following page for this section.]
     <br/>
     Now Aglaia (Aglaea) stood by him [Eros], and she received the prizes from the hands of the prince of heart's delight. She beckoned the boy aside, and with silence their only witness, she whispered into his ear the artful message of her intriguing mistress : ‘Allvanquisher unvanquished, preserver of life coeval with the universe, make haste! Kythereia (Cytherea) is in distress. None of her attendants has remained with her; Kharis (Charis, Grace) has gone, Peitho (Seduction) has vanished, Pothos (Sexual Longing) the inconstant has left her; she had none to send but me. She needs your invincible quiver!’
     <br/>
     No sooner had she spoken, than Eros wanted to know all about it; for all young people, when they hear only the beginning of a story, are eager to hear the end. So he rattled out with that unbridled tongue of his--‘Who has hurt my dear Paphian? Let me take arms in hand and fight all the world! If my mother is in distress, let me stretch my allvanquishing bowstring against even Kronion (Cronion) [Zeus], to make him once more a mad ravishing love-bird, and eagle, or a bull swimming in the sea! Or if Pallas [Athene] has provoked her, if Crookshank [Hephaistos (Hephaestus)] has hurt her by lighting the bright torch of the Kekropian (Cecropian) light, I will fight them both, Hephaistos and Athene! Or if Archeress [Artemis] hareslayer moves her to anger, I will draw the fiery Olympian sword of Orion to prick Artemis and drive her out of the sky! Or if it is Hermes I will carry off with me Maia's son on my wings, and let him call useless Peitho [his wife] in vain to his help. Or I will leave my arrows and the fiery belt of my quiver, I will lash Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon] a willing victim with cords of laurel leaves, holding him bound in a belt of speaking iris. Indeed I fear not the strength of Enyalios [Ares], it will not weary me to flog Ares when he is shackled by the delightful cestus. The two luminaries I will drag down from heaven to be drudges in Paphos, and give my mother for a servant Phaethon [Helios the Sun] with Klymene (Clymene) [his wife], Selene [the Moon] with Endymion [her husband], that all may know that I vanquish all things!’
     <br/>
     He spoke, and straight through the air he plied his feet, and reached the dwelling of eager Aphrodite long before Aglaia with his pair of whirring wings. His mother with serene countenance took him into her embrace, and threw one happy arm round her boy, lifting him on her knees, a welcome burden. He sat there while she kissed the boy's lips and eyes; then she touched his mindcharming bow, and handled the quiver, and pretending to breathe anger, spoke these delusive words : ‘My dear child, you have forgotten Phaethon [Helios the Sun] and Kythereia (Cytherea) [Aphrodite]! Pasiphae no longer wants the Bull's love. Helios mocks at me, and arms the offspring of Astris, the warrior Deriades his own daughter's son, to destroy the Bassarides of womanmad Dionysos and to rout the love-stricken Satyroi (Satyrs) of Bromios. But it has provoked me more than all, that battlestirring Ares in mortal shape, with Enyo by his side, without regard for his old love of Aphrodite, ahs armed himself against Dionysos at Hera's bidding and supports the Indian king. Now then, on this field Ares if for Deriades--then you fight for Lyaios (Lyaeus) [Dionysos]. He has a spear, you have a stronger bow, before which bend the knee Zeus the Highest and furious Ares and Hermes the lawgiver; even that Archer Apollon fears your bow. If you will give a boon to your Foamborn, fight for the Bassarides and Dionysos. Go I pray, to the Eastern clime and let no one catch you--go to the Indian plain, where there is a handmaid of Lyaios amongst the Bakkhantes (Bacchantes), more excellent than her yearsmates, named Khalkomede (Chalcomede), who loves the maiden state--but if you should see Khalkomede and Kypris (Cypris) both together in Libanos (Lebanon), you cannot tell which was Aphrodite, my dear boy! Go to that place and help Dionysos ranging the wilds, by shooting Morrheus for the beauty of Khalkomedeia. I will give you a Worthing prize for your shooting, a wellmade Lemnian chaplet, like the rays of fiery Helios (the Sun). Shoot a sweet arrow, and you will do a grace both to Kypris and to dionysos; honour my bridesmaid bird of love [the dove] and yours, the herald of lifelong wedding and happy hearts!’
     <br/>
     So spoke the goddess; and Eros wildly leapt from his mother's lap and took up his bow, slung the allvanquishing quiver about his little shoulder, and sailed away on his wings through the air; round Kerne (Cerne) he turned his flight opposite the rays of morning, smiling that he had set afire that great charioteer of the heavenly car with his little darts, and the light of the loves had conquered the light of Helios (the Sun). Soon he was moving in the midst of the Indian host, and laid his bow against the neck of Khalkomedeia, aiming the shaft round her rosy cheek, and sent it into the heart of Morrheus. Then paddling his way with the double beat of his floating wings he mounted to the starry barriers of his father [i.e. Ouranos (Uranus, Sky) father of Aphrodite who emerged fully grown and pregnant with Eros from bloody foam of Ouranos' castration], leaving the Indian transfixed with the fiery shaft.
     <br/>
     Now Morrheus moved lovesick this way and that way, struck by the arrow of desire, wherever the maiden went; the sword he lifted was tame, his spear hung idle, his bold spirit was lashed by the cestus of love, he turned his enamoured gaze all about and moved his eyes at the bidding of Kypri (Cypris)s, uncomforted."

No more I equip a fighting hand against Bassarides. The gods of my nation, Water and Earth, I will leave, and set up altars both to Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite] and Dionysos; I will throw away the brazen spear of Enyalios [Ares] and Athene.’"

     After the arrival of the Argonauts in Kolkhis (Colchis), the goddess Hera conspires to have  Medea fall in love with Jason to assist the hero in his quest for the Golden Fleece. To this end she petitions Aphrodite have her son Eros strike the princess with his darts.

     <span class="quote-greek">

     <br/>
     The solution to their problem pleased Athene, who smilingly replied : ‘Sprung as I am from Zeus, I have never felt the arrows of the Boy, and of love-charms I know nothing.’"
    </p>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-greek">
      Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 3. 82 ff :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[Hera addresses Aphrodite :] ‘All we require of you is quietly to tell your boy to use his wizardry and make Aeetes' daughter fall in love with Iason (Jason) . . .’
     <br/>
     ‘But ladies,’ said Kypris (Cypris) [Aphrodite], speaking now to both of them [i.e. Hera and Athene], ‘he is far more likely to obey you than me. There is no reverence in him, but faced by you he might display some spark of decent feeling. He certainly pays no attention to me: he defies me and always does the opposite of what I say. In fact I am so worn out by his naughtiness that I have half a mind to break his bow and wicked arrows in his very sight, remembering how he threatened me with them in one of his moods. He said, "If you don't keep your hands off me while I can still control my temper, you can blame yourself for the consequences."’
     <br/>
     Hera and Athene smiled at this and exchanged glances. But Aphrodite was hurt. She said : ‘Other people find my troubles amusing. I really should not speak of them to all and sundry; it is enough for me to know them. However, as you have both set your hearts on it, I will try and coax my boy. He will not refuse.’
     <br/>
     Hera took Aphrodite's slender hand in hers and with a sweet smile replied : ‘Very well, Kytherea (Cytherea). Play your part, just as you say; but quickly, please. And do not scold or argue with your child when he annoys you. He will improve by and by.’
     <br/>
     With that she rose to go. Athene followed her, and the pair left for home. Kypris (Cypris) too set out, and after searching up and down Olympos for her boy, found him far away in the fruit-laden orchard of Zeus. With him was Ganymede, whose beauty had so captivated Zeus that he took him up to heaven to live with the immortals. The two lads, who had much in common, were playing with golden knuckle-bones. Eros, the greedy boy, was standing there with a whole handful of them clutched to his breast and a happy flush of mantling his cheeks. Near by sat Ganymede, hunched up, silent and disconsolate with only two left. He threw these for what they were worth in quick succession and was furious when Eros laughed. Of course he lost them both immediately--they joined the rest. So he went off in despair with empty hands and did not notice the goddess's approach.
     <br/>
     Aphrodite came up to her boy, took his chin in her hand and said : ‘Why this triumphant smile, you rascal? I do believe you won the game unfairly be cheating a beginner. But listen now. Will you be good and do me a favour I am going to ask of you? Then I will give you one of Zeus's lovely toys, the one that his fond nurse Adresteia (Adrastia) made for him in the Idaian cave when he was still a child and liked to play. It is a perfect ball; Hephaistos (Hephaestus) himself could not make you a better toy. It is made of golden hoops laced together all the way round with double stitching; but the seams are hidden by a winding blue band. When you throw it up, it will leave a fiery trail behind it like a meteor in the sky. That is what I'll give you, if you let fly an arrow at Aeetes' girl [Medea] and make her fall in love with Iason (Jason). But you must act at once, or I may not be so generous.’
     <br/>
     When he heard this, Eros was delighted. He threw down all his toys, flung his arms round his mother and hung on to her skirt with both hands, imploring her to let him have the ball at once. But she gently refused, and drawing him towards her, held him close and kissed his cheeks. Then with a smile she said, ‘By your own dear head and mine, I swear I will not disappoint you. You shall have the gift when you have shot an arrow into Medea's heart.’
     <br/>
     Eros gathered up his knuckle-bones, counted them all carefully, and put them in the fold of his mother's shining robe. Fetching his quiver from where it leant against a tree, he slung it on his shoulder with a golden strap, picked up his crooked bow, and made his way through the luxuriant orchard of Zeus' palace. Then he passed through the celestial gates of Olympos, where a pathway for the gods leads down, and twin poles, earth's highest points, soar in lofty pinnacles that catch the first rays of the risen sun. And as he swept on through the boundless air he saw ever-changing scene beneath him, here the life-supporting land with its peopled cities and its sacred rivers, here mountain peaks, and hear the all-encircling sea . . .
     <br/>
     Eros, passing through the clear air, had arrived unseen and bent on mischief, like a gladfly setting out to plague the grazing heifers, the fly that cowherds call the breese. In the porch, under the lintel of the door, the quickly strung his vow and from his quiver took a new arrow, fraught with pain. Still unobserved, he ran across the threshold glancing around him sharply. Then he crouched low at Iason's feet, fitted the notch to the middle of the string, and drawing the bow as far as his hands would stretch, shot at Medea. And her heart stood still.
     <br/>
     With a happy laugh Eros sped out of the high-roofed hall on his way back, leaving his shaft deep in the girl's breast, hot as fire. Time and again she darted a bright glance at Iason (Jason). All else was forgotten. Her heart, brimful of this new agony, throbbed within her and overflowed with the sweetness of the pain."

     "Unconscionable Eros, bane and tormentor of mankind, parent of strife, fountain of tears, source of a thousand ills, rise mighty Power, and fall on the ons of our enemies with all the force you used upon Medea when you filled her with insensate fury [i.e. she plotted the murder of her own brother for the love of Iason (Jason)]."

      Philostratus the Younger, Imagines 8 (trans. Fairbanks) (Greek rhetorician C3rd A.D.) :

     "[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting depicting a scene from Apollonius'
     <em>
      Argonautica
     </em>
     :] [Aphrodite, Hera and Athena approach Eros who is playing a game with Ganymedes.] . . . 
  What do the goddesses desire and what necessity brings them together? The Argo carrying its fifty heroes has anchored in the Phasis after passing through the Bosphoros (Bosphorus) and the Clashing Rocks . . . While the sailors of the Argo are considering the situation, the goddesses have come as suppliants to be Eros that he assist them in saving the sailors by going to fetch Medeia (Medea), the daughter of Aietes (Aeetes); and as pay for this service his mother shows him a ball which she says was once a plaything of Zeus. Do you see the clever art of the painting? The ball itself is of gold; the stitching on it is such as to be assumed by the mind rather than seen by the eye, and spirals of blue encircle it; and very likely, when it is tossed in the air, the radiance emanating from it will lead us to compare it with the twinkling of stars. As for Eros, he no longer even looks at the dice, but throwing them on the ground he clings to his mother's [Aphrodite's] dress, begging her to make good her promise to him; for, he says, he will not fail in the task."
