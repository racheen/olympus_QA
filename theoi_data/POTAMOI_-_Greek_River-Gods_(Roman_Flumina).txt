   POTAMOI - Greek River-Gods (Roman Flumina)
  </title>
  <meta content="The Potamoi were the ancient Greek gods of the rivers and streams of the earth, all sons of the great earth-encirling river Oceanus. The River-God was depicted in one of three forms:--as a man-headed bull; a bull-horned man with the tail of a serpentine-fish in place of legs; or as a reclining man with an arm resting upon a pitcher pouring water." name="description"/>

     THE POTAMOI were the gods of the rivers and streams of the earth, all sons of the great earth-encirling river Okeanos (Oceanus). Their sisters were the
     <a href="../Nymphe/Okeanides.html">
      Okeanides (Oceanids)
     </a>
     , goddesses of small streams, clouds and rain, and their daughters were the Naiades, nymphs of  springs and fountains.
    </p>
    <p>
     The River-God was depicted in one of three forms:--as  a man-headed bull;  a bull-horned man with the tail of a serpentine-fish in place of legs; or as a reclining man with an arm resting upon a pitcher pouring water.

    <h4>
     I. RIVER-GODS FIRST KINGS OF THE LAND
    </h4>
    <p>
     River-Gods were sometimes described as the first, aboriginal kings of the land. The most famous of these were Asopos river-king of Sikyonia, Inakhos (Inachus) river-king of Argos, and Eurotas river-king of Lakedaimonia. In the rationalisations of late antiquity, these figures were often redefined as mortal kings who gave their names to rivers rather than the Rivers themselves.

Some sit on his shoulders, some cling to his curling locks, some are asleep on his arms, and some romp on his breast. And he yields them flowers, some form his lap and some from his arms, that they may weave them into crowns and, sacred and fragrant themselves, may have a bed of flowers to sleep upon. And the children climb up one on another with sistra in their hands, instruments the sound of which is familiar to that river. Crocodiles, however, and hippopotami, which some artists associate with Neilos (the Nile) in their paintings, are now lying aloof in its deep eddies so as not to frighten the children. But that the River is Neilos is indicated, my boy, by symbols of agriculture and navigation, and for the following reason : At its flood Neilos makes Egypt open to boats; then, when it has been drunk up by the fields, it gives the people a fertile land to till; and in Aithiopia (Ethiopia), where it takes its rise, a divinity is set over it as its steward, and he it is who sends forth its water at the right seasons. This divinity has been painted so as to seem heaven-high, and he plants his foot on the sources, his head bent forward like Poseidon. Toward him the River is looking, and it prays that its infants may be many."
