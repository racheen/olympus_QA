   PAN - Greek God of Shepherds, Hunters &amp; the Wilds (Roman Faunus)
  </title>
  <meta content="Pan was the ancient Greek god of shepherds and hunters, and of the meadows and forests of the mountain wilds. His unseen presence aroused panic in those who traversed his realm. Pan idled in the rugged countryside of Arcadia, playing his panpipes and chasing Nymphs. Pan was depicted as a man with the horns, legs and tail of a goat, a thick beard, snub nose and pointed ears. His Roman name was Faunus." name="description"/>

     PAN was the god of shepherds and hunters, and of the meadows and forests of the mountain wilds. His unseen presence aroused panic in those who traversed his realm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pan idled in the rugged countryside of Arkadia (Arcadia), playing his panpipes and chasing
     <a href="../Nymphe/Nymphai.html">
      Nymphs
     </a>
     . One of these,
     <a href="../Nymphe/NymphePitys.html">
      Pitys
     </a>
     , fled his advances and was transformed into a mountain-pine, the god's sacred tree. Another,
     <a href="../Nymphe/NympheSyrinx.html">
      Syrinx
     </a>
     , escaped but was turned into a clump of reeds from which Pan crafted his pipes. And a third,
     <a href="../Nymphe/NympheEkho.html">
      Ekho (Echo)
     </a>
     ,  was cursed to fade away for spurning the god, leaving behind just a voice to repeat his mountain cries.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pan was depicted as a man with the horns, legs and tail of a goat, a thick beard, snub nose and pointed ears. He often appears in scenes of the company of
     <a href="../Olympios/Dionysos.html">
      Dionysos
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     In the classical age the Greeks associated his name with the word
     <em>
      pan
     </em>
     meaning "all". However its true origin lay in an old Arcadian word for rustic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pan was closely identified with several other rustic deities including
     <a href="Aristaios.html">
      Aristaios (Aristaeus)
     </a>
     , the shepherd-god of northern Greece who shared the god's titles of Agreus (Hunter) and Nomios (Shepherd), the pipe-playing Phrygian satyr
     <a href="SatyrosMarsyas.html">
      Marsyas
     </a>
     who challenged Apollon to a musical contest, and
     <a href="Aigipan.html">
      Aigipan (Aegipan)
     </a>
     , the goat-fish god of the constellation Capricorn. Sometimes Pan was multiplied into a host of
     <a href="Panes.html">
      Panes
     </a>
     , or a triad of gods named
     <a href="PanesAgreusNomios.html">
      Agreus
     </a>
     ,
     <a href="PanesAgreusNomios.html">
      Nomios
     </a>
     , and Phorbas.

     PAN (Pan), the great god of flocks and shepherds among the Greeks; his name is probably connected with the verb
     <em>
      paô
     </em>
     . Lat.
     <em>
      pasco,
     </em>
     so that his name and character are perfectly in accordance with each other. Later speculations, according to which Pan is the same as
     <em>
      to
     </em>
     <em>
      pan
     </em>
     , or the universe, and the god the symbol of the universe, cannot be taken into consideration here. He is described as a son of Hermes by the daughter of Dryops (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     vii. 34), by Callisto (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocr.
     </em>
     i. 3), by Oeneis or Thymbris (Apollod. i. 4. § 1; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit. l. c.
     </em>
     ), or as the son of Hermes by Penelope, whom the god visited in the shape of a ram (Herod. ii. 145; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit.
     </em>
     i. 123 ; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     ii. 43), or of Penelope by Odysseus, or by all her suitors in common. (Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Georg.
     </em>
     i. 16; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph.
     </em>
     766; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit.
     </em>
     i. 3.) Some again call him the son of Aether and Oeneis, or a Nereid, or a son of Uranus and Ge. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Theocrit.
     </em>
     i. 123; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph. l. c.
     </em>
     ) From his being a grandson or great grandson of Cronos, he is called Kronios. (Eurip.
     <em>
      Rhes.
     </em>
     36.) He was from his birth perfectly developed, and had the same appearance as afterwards, that is, he had his horns, beard, puck nose, tail, goats' feet, and was covered with hair, so that his mother ran away with fear when she saw him ; but Hermes carried him into Olympus, where all (pantes) the gods were delighted with him, and especially Dionysus. (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     vii. 36, &amp;c.; comp. Sil. Ital. xiii. 332; Lucian,
     <em>
      Dial. Deor.
     </em>
     22.) He was brought up by nymphs. (Paus. viii. 30. § 2.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The principal seat of his worship was Arcadia and from thence his name and his worship afterwards spread over other parts of Greece; and at Athens his worship was not introduced till the time of the battle of Marathon. (Paus. viii. 26. § 2; Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     x. 26; Pind.
     <em>
      Frag.
     </em>
     63, ed. Boeckh.; Herod. ii. 145.) In Arcadia he was the god of forests, pastures, flocks, and shepherds, and dwelt in grottoes (Eurip.
     <em>
      Ion,
     </em>
     501; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xiv. 515), wandered on the summits of mountains and rocks, and in valleys, either amusing himself with the chase, or leading the dances of the nymphs. (Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Pers.
     </em>
     448; Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     vii. 6, 13, 20 ; Paus. viii. 42. § 2.) As the god of flocks, both of wild and tame animals, it was his province to increase them and guard them (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     vii. 5; Paus. viii. 38. § 8; Ov.
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     ii. 271, 277 ;
     <em>
      Virg. Eclog.
     </em>
     i. 33); but he was also a hunter, and hunters owed their success to him, who at the same time might prevent their being successful. (Hesych.
     <em>
      s. v.
     </em>
     Agreus.) In Arcadia hunters used to scourge the statue, if they hunted in vain (Theocrit. vii. 107); during the heat of mid day he used to slumber, and was very indignant when any one disturbed him. (Theocrit. i. 16.) As god of flocks, bees also were under his protection, as well as the coast where fishermen carried on their pursuit. (Theocrit. v. 15;
     <em>
      Anthol. Palat.
     </em>
     vi. 239, x. 10.) As the god of every thing connected with pastoral life, he was fond of music, and the inventor of the syrinx or shepherd's flute, which he himself played in a masterly manner, and in which he instructed others also, such as Daphnis. (Hom.
     <em>
      Hymn.
     </em>
     vii. 15 ; Theocrit. i. 3;
     <em>
      Anthol.
     </em>
     <em>
      Palat
     </em>
     <em>
      .
     </em>
     ix. 237, x. 11; Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     i. 32, iv. 58; Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Eclog.
     </em>
     v. 20.) He is thus said to have loved the poet Pindar, and to have sung and danced his lyric songs, in return for which Pindar erected to him a sanctuary in front of his house. (Pind.
     <em>
      Pyth.
     </em>
     iii. 139, with the Schol.; Plut.
     <em>
      Num.
     </em>
     4.) Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by travellers to whom he sometimes appeared, and whom he startled with a sudden awe or terror. (Eurip.
     <em>
      Rhes.
     </em>
     36.) Thus when Pheidippides, the Athenian, was sent to Sparta to solicit its aid against the Persians, Pan accosted him, and promised to terrify the barbarians, if the Athenians would worship him. (Herod. vi. 105 ; Paus. viii. 54. § 5, i. 28. § 4.) He is said to have had a terrific voice (Val. Flacc. iii. 31), and by it to have frightened the Titans in their fight with the gods. (Eratosth.
     <em>
      Catast.
     </em>
     27.) It seems that this feature, namely, his fondness of noise and riot, was the cause of his being considered as the minister and companion of Cybele and Dionysus. (Val. Flacc. iii. 47; Pind.
     <em>
      Fragm.
     </em>
     63, ed. Boeckh; Lucian,
     <em>
      Dial. Deor.
     </em>
     22.) He was at the same time believed to be possessed of prophetic powers, and to have even instructed Apollo in this art. (Apollod. i. 4. § 1.) While roaming in his forests he fell in love with Echo, by whom or by Peitho he became the father of Iynx. His love of Syrinx, after whom he named his flute, is well known from Ovid (
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 691, &amp;c.; comp. Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Eclog.
     </em>
     ii. 31; and about his other amours see
     <em>
      Georg.
     </em>
     iii. 391; Macrob.
     <em>
      Sat.
     </em>
     v. 22). Fir-trees were sacred to him, as the nymph Pitys, whom he loved, had been metamorphosed into that tree (Propert. i. 18. 20), and the sacrifices offered to him consisted of cows, rams, lambs, milk, and honey. (Theocrit. v. 58;
     <em>
      Anthol. Pa
     </em>
     la
     <em>
      t.
     </em>
     ii. 630, 697, vi. 96, 239, vii. 59.) Sacrifices were also offered to him in common with Dionysus and the nymphs. (Paus. ii. 24. § 7;
     <em>
      Anthol. Palat.
     </em>
     vi. 154.) The various epithets which are given him by the poets refer either to his singular appearance, or are derived from the names of the places in which he was worshipped. Sanctuaries and temples of this god are frequently mentioned, especially in Arcadia, as at Heraea, on the Nomian hill near Lycosura, on mount Parthenius (Paus. viii. 26. § 2, 38. § 8, 54. § 5), at Megalopolis (viii. 30. § 2, iii. 31. § 1), near Acacesium, where a perpetual fire was burning in his temple, and where at the same time there was an ancient oracle, at which the nymph Erato had been his priestess (viii. 37. § 8, &amp;c.), at Troezene (ii. 32. § 5), on the well of Eresinus, between Argos and Tegea (ii. 24. § 7), at Sicyon ii. 10. § 2), at Oropus (i. 34. § 2), at Athens (i. 28. § 4; Herod. vi. 105), near Marathon (i. 32. in fin.), in the island of Psyttaleia (i. 36. § 2 ; Aeschyl.
     <em>
      Pers.
     </em>
     448), in the Corycian grotto near mount Parnassus (x. 32. § 5), and at Homala in Thessaly. (Theocrit. vii. 103.)

     The Romans identified with Pan their own god Inuus, and sometimes also Faunus. Respecting the plural (Panes) or beings with goat's feet, see Satyri. In works of art Pan is represented as a voluptuous and sensual being, with horns, puck-nose, and goat's feet, sometimes in the act of dancing, and sometimes playing on the syrinx.

      Homeric Hymn 19 to Pan (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th - 4th B.C.) :

     <br/>
     "Hermes . . . came to Arkadia (Arcadia), the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Kyllene (Cyllene). For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed a strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryopos (Dryops), and there he brought about the merry marriage. And in the house she bare Hermes a dear son who from his birth was marvellouse to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns--a noisy, merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard, she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child. Then luck-bringing Hermes received him and took him in his arms : very glad in his heart was the god. And he went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods, carrying his son wrapped in warm skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside Zeus and showed him to the rest of the gods. Then all the immortals were glad in heart and Bakkheios (Bacchic) Dionysos in especial; and they called the boy Pan [i.e. derived from the word
     <em>
      pantes
     </em>
     meaning ‘all’] because he delighted all their hearts."

Had Dionysos son of Semele and Pan son of Penelope appeared in Hellas and lived there to old age, like Herakles the son of Amphitryon, it might have been said that they too (like Herakles) were but men, named after the older Pan and Dionysos, the gods of antiquity;  but as it is . . . for Pan, the Greeks do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge."

     Pan was sometimes identified with the goat-fish god Aigipan (Aegipan) who assisted Zeus in his battles with the monster Typhoeus. Aigipan and Pan do appear together in one C5th B.C. Greek vase painting which demonstrates that they were often regarded as two distinct deities.

Afterwards, they say, angry with Poseidon and grieved at the rape of Persephone, she [Demeter] put on black apparel and shut herself up in this cavern for a long time.

Roaming from mountain to mountain as he hunted, he came at last to Mount Elaios (Elaeus) and spied Demeter, the state she was in and the clothes she wore. So Zeus learnt this from Pan, and sent the Moirai (Fates) to Demeter, who listened to the Moirai (Moirae, Fates) and laid aside her wrath, moderating her grief as well."

     <br/>
     "Loathing riches [after being shed of his golden touch] Midas gave his heart to fields and forests and the countryside and Pan who dwells among the mountain caves. But crass his wits remained, in folly set to bring their master trouble as before. The crags of Tmolus, steep and wide and high, gazing across the sea, at one side fall to Sardis, at the other reach their end at small Hypaepae. There Pan sang his songs, flaunting among the gently Nymphae (Nymphs), and played light airs upon his pipes, and dared to boast Apollo's music second to his own, essaying with old Tmolus as the judge unequal contest. On his mountain top the judge was seated; from his ears he freed the forest trees; only a wreath of oak fringed his green locks, with acorns dangling round his hollow temples. Then, looking towards the shepherd-god, he said, ‘The judge attends.’
     <br/>
     So Pan made music on his rustic reeds and with his uncouth song entranced the king. Midas by chance was there. To Phoebus [Apollon] next grave Tmolus turned and, as he turned, his fringe of trees turned too. Apollo's golden hair was garlanded with laurel of Parnassus; his mantle, rich with Tyrian purple, swept the ground he trod; in his left had he bore his lyre, inlaid with gems and ivory; his right the plectrum held; his very pose proclaimed the artist. Then with expert touch he plucked the strings and, won by strains so sweet, old Tmolus bade the reed bow to the lyre. The sacred Mountain's (
     <em>
      Mons
     </em>
     ) judgement and award pleased all who heard; yet one voice challenging, crass-witted Midas' voice, called in unjust. Delius [Apollon] could not suffer ears so dull to keep their human shape. He filled them with coarse grey hairs, and hinged their base to move and twitch and flop; all else was man; in that one part his punishment; he wears henceforth a little ambling ass's ears. Disfigured and ashamed he sought to hide his temples with a clinging purple turban."

Many a time she foiled the chasing Satyri and those gods who haunt the shady copses and the coverts of the lush countryside.

     Indeed she was mistaken. Pan returning from Mount Lycaeus, crowned with his wreath of pine, saw Syrinx once and said--‘but what he said remained to tell, and how the scornful Nympha fled through the wilderness and came at last to Ladon's peaceful sandy stream, and there, her flight barred by the river, begged her Watery Sisters (

     <br/>
     "[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting at Neapolis (Naples) :] Pan, the Nymphai (Nymphs) say, dances badly and goes beyond bounds in his leaping, leaping up and jumping aloft after the manner of sportive goats; and they say that they would teach him a different kind of dancing, or a more delightful character; when he, however, pays no heed to them but, his garment extended, tries to make love to them they set upon him at noon, when Pan is said to abandon the hunt and go to sleep. Formerly he used to sleep relaxed, with peaceful nostril and soothing his angry spirit with slumber, but today he is very angry; for the Nymphai have fallen upon him, and already Pan's hands have been tied behind his back, and he fears for his legs since the Nymphai wish to seize them. Moreover, his beard, which he values most highly, has been shaven off with razors which have been roughly applies to it, and they say that they will persuade Ekho (Echo) to scorn him and no longer even to answer his call. Here are the Nymphai in a group, but do you look at them by classes; for some are Naides (Naiads, Water Nymphai)--these who are shaking drops of dew from their hair; and the lean slenderness of the Boukolai (Bucolae, Pastoral Nymphai) is no white less beautiful than dew; and the Anthousai (Anthusae, Flower Nymphai) have hair that resembles hyacinth flowers."

      Statius, Silvae 2. 3. 1 (trans. Mozley) (Roman poetry C1st A.D.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "Enfolding with tis overshadowing boughs the clear waters of my elegant Melior's [a patron of the author Statius] lake there stands a tree, whose trunk, curing from its base, bends down towards the mere, and then shoots up aloft straight to its summit, as though it grew a second time from the midst of the waves, and dwelt with hidden roots in the glassy stream. Why ask so slight a tale of Phoebus [Apollon]? Do you, O Naides, relate the cause, and you compliant Fauni [Satyroi (Satyrs)]--ye will suffice--inspire my song.
     <br/>
     Frightened troops of Nymphae (Nymphs) were fleeing from Pan; on he came, as though all were his quarry, yet on Pholoe alone was he bent. By copse and stream she fled, shunning now the hairy following limbs, now the wanton horns. Through Janus' grove [at the foot of the Capitol at Rome], scene of battles, and Cacus' deadly haunts [on the Aventine hill]; through the fields of Quirinus she came running a-tiptoe and gained the Caelian wilds; there at last wearied out and fordone with fear--where to-day stand the quiet home of hospitable Melior--she gathered her saffron robe closer about her, and sank down on the edge of the snow-white bank. Swiftly follows the shepherd-god, and deems the maid his bride; already he allays the panting of his fevered breast, already he hovers lightly o'er his prey.
     <br/>
     Lo! With speedy steps Diana [Artemis] approached, as she ranges the seven hills and tracks the flight of a deer on Aventine; the goddess was vexed to see it, and turning to her trusty comrades: ‘Shall I never keep this unseemly, wanton brood from lustful rapine? Must my chaste band of followers ever grow fewer?’
     <br/>
     So speaking she drew a short shaft from her quiver, but sped it not from the bent bow or with the wonted twang, but was content to fling it with one hand, and touched-- so 'tis said--the left hand of the drowsy Naiad with the arrow-feathers. She awaking beheld at once the day and her wanton foe, and lest she should bare her snow-white limbs plunged just as she was with all her raiment into the lake, and at the bottom of the mere, believing Pan was following, she wrapped the weeds about her. What could the robber do, so suddenly baffled? Conscious of his shaggy hide, and from childhood untaught to swim, he dares not trust himself to the deep waters.
     <br/>
     Lavish complaint made he of heartless Bromius [Dionysos], of the jealous lake and jealous shaft; then spying a young plane tree with long stem and countless branches and summit aspiring to heaven he set it by him and heaped fresh sand about it and sprinkled it with the longed-for waters, and thus commanded it : ‘Live long, O tree, as the memorable token of my vow, and do thou at least stoop down and cherish the secret abode of this hard-hearted Nympha, and cover her waters with thy leaves. Let her not, I pray, though she has deserved it, be scorched by the sun's heat or lashed by cruel hail; only mind thou to bestrew the pool with thickly scattered leaves. Then will I long remember thee and the mistress of this kindly place, and guard both a secure old age, so that the trees of Jove [the oak of Zeus] and Phoebus [the laurel of Apollon], and the twy-coloured poplar shade and my own pines may marvel at thy boughs.’
     <br/>
     So he spake; and the tree, quickened with the old passion of the god, hangs and broods over the full mere with drooping stem, and searches the waves with loving shadows, and hops for their embrace; but he breath of the waters put it from them, and suffered not its touch. At length it struggles upward, and poised upon its base cunningly lifts its head without any knot, as though it sank with another root into the bottom of the lake. Now not even the Nais, Phoebe's [Artemis'] votary, hates it, but her stream invites the boughs she banished."

     "[Psykhe (Psyche), despairing at having lost the love of Eros (Cupid), thought to cast herself into a river :] The rustic god Pan chanced to be sitting at that moment on the brow of the stream, holding the mountain deity Echo in his arms, and teaching her to repeat after him all kinds of songs. Close by the bank nanny-goats were sporting as they grazed and cropped the river-foliage here and there. The goat-shaped god was well aware of the calamity that had befallen Psyche. He called her gently to him, lovesick and weary as she was, and soothed her with these consoling words. ‘You are an elegant girl, and I am a rustic herdsman, but my advanced years give me the benefit of considerable experience. If my hazard is correct--sages actually call such guesswork divine insight--I infer from your stumbling and frequently wandering steps, from your excessively pale complexion and continual sighs, and not least from your mournful gaze, that you are suffering grievous love-pains. On that account you must hearken to me: do not seek gain to destroy yourself by throwing yourself headlong or by seeking any other means of death. Cease your sorrowing, lay aside your sadness, and instead direct prayers of adoration to Cupidos (Cupid) [Eros], greatest of gods, and by your caressing attentions win the favour of that wanton and extravagant youth.’
     <br/>
     Psyche made no reply to this advice from the shepherd-god. She merely paid reverential homage to his divine person, and proceeded on her way."

      Homeric Hymn 19 to Pan (trans. Evelyn-White) (Greek epic C7th or 6th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "Mousa (Muse), tell me about Pan, the dear son of Hermes, with his goat's feet and two horns--a lover of merry noise. Through wooded glades he wanders with dancing Nymphai who foot it on some sheer cliff's edge, calling upon Pan, the shepherd god (
     <em>
      theos nomios
     </em>
     ), long-haired, unkempt. He has every snowy crest and the mountain peaks and rocky crests for his domain; hither and thither he goes through the close thickets, now lured by soft streams, and now he presses on amongst towering crags and climbs up to the highest peak that overlooks the flocks. Often he courses through the glistening high mountains, and often on the shouldering hills he speeds along slaying wild beasts, this keen-eyed god. Only at evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note, playng sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could excel him in melody - that bird who flower-laden spring pouring forth her lament uters honey-voiced song amid the leaves. At that hour the clear-voiced Nymphai are with him and move with nimble feet, singing by some spring of dark water, while Ekho (Echo) wails about the mountain-top, and the god on this side or on that of the choirs, or at times sidling into the midst, plies it nimbly with his feet. On his back he wears a spotted lynx-pelt, and he delights in high-pitched songs in a soft meadow where crocuses and sweet-smelling hyacinths bloom at random in the grass.
     <br/>
     They sing of the blessed gods and high Olympos (Olympus) and choose to tell of such a one as luck-brining Hermes above the rest, how he is the swift messenger of all the gods, and how he came to Arkadia (Arcadia), the land of many springs and mother of flocks, there where his sacred place is as god of Kyllene (Cyllene). For there, though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed a strong melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryopos (Dryops), and there he brought about the merry marriage. And in the house she bare Hermes a dear son who from his birth was marvellouse to look upon, with goat's feet and two horns--a noisy, merry-laughing child. But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard, she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child. Then luck-bringing Hermes received him and took him in his arms: very glad in his heart was the god. And he went quickly to the abodes of the deathless gods, carrying his son wrapped in warm skins of mountain hares, and set him down beside Zeus and showed him to the rest of the gods. Then all the immortals were glad in heart and Bakkheios (Bacchian) Dionysos in especial; and they called the boy Pan because he delighted all their hearts [i.e. because
     <em>
      pan
     </em>
     means "all"]. 
  And so hail to you, lord! I seek your favour with a song."

Come, blessed Pan, whom rural haunts delight, come, leaping, agile, wandering, starry light. Throned with the Horai (Horae, Seasons), Bakkhanalian (Bacchanalian) Pan, goat-footed, horned, from whom the world began; in endless dance and melody divine. In thee a refuge from our fears we find, those fears peculiar to humankind. Thee, shepherds, streams of water, goats rejoice, thou lovest the chase and Ekho's (Echo's) secret voice : the sportive Nymphai (Nymphs) thy every step attend, and all thy works fulfil their destined end. O all-producing power, much-famed, divine, the world's great ruler, rich increase is thine. All-fertile Paian (Paean), heavenly splendour pure, in fruits rejoicing, and in caves obscure. True serpent-horned Zeus, whose dreadful rage, when roused, 'tis hard for mortals to assuage. By thee the earth wide-bosomed, deep and long, stands on a basis permanent and strong. The unwearied waters of the rolling sea, profoundly spreading, yield to thy decree. Old Okeanos (Oceanus), too, reveres thy high command, whose liquid arms begird the solid land. The spacious air, whose nutrimental fire and vivid blasts the heat of life inspire; the lighter frame of fire, whose sparkling eye shines on the summit of the azure sky, submit alike to thee, whose general sway all parts of matter, various formed, obey. All natures change through thy protecting are, and all mankind thy liberal bounties share; for these, wherever dispersed through boundless space, still find thy providence support their race. Come, Bakkhanalian, blessed power, draw near, enthusiastic Pan, thy suppliants hear, propitious to these holy rites attend, and grant our lives may meet a prosperous end; drive panic fury too, wherever found, from humankind to earth's remotest bound."

Twelve horned Panes there were, with this changeling shape and hornbearing head, who were begotten of the one ancestral Pan their mountainranging father . . . With these were two other Panes, the sons of Hermes [i.e. the two aspects of Pan--Hunter and Shepherd], who divided his love between two Nymphai (Nymphs); for one he visited the bed of Sose, the highland prophetess, and begat a son inspired with the divine voice of prophecy, Agreus (Hunter), well versed in the beast-slaying sport of the hunt; the other was Nomios (Shepherd), whom the pasturing sheep loved well, one practised in the shepherd's pipe, for whom Hermes sought the bed of Penelope the country Nymphe."

      Plato, Cratylus 400d &amp; 408b (trans. Lamb) (Greek philosopher C4th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[Plato invents philosophical explanations for the names of the gods :]
     <br/>
     Sokrates (Socrates) : Let us inquire what thought men had in giving them [the gods] their names . . . The first men who gave names [to the gods] were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers . . . And it is reasonable, my friend, that Pan is the double-natured son of Hermes [whose name Sokrates derives from the word for ‘speech’] . . . You know that speech makes all things (
     <em>
      pan
     </em>
     ) known and always makes them circulate and move about, and is twofold, true and false . . . Well, the true part is smooth and divine and dwells aloft among the gods, but falsehood dwells below among common men, is rough and like the tragic goat [see note]; for tales and falsehoods are most at home there, in the tragic life . . . Then Pan, who declares and always moves (
     <em>
      aei polôn
     </em>
     ) all, is rightly called goat-herd (
     <em>
      aipolos
     </em>
     ), being the double-natured son of Hermes, smooth in his upper parts, rough and goat-like in his lower parts. And Pan, if he is the son of Hermes, is either speech or the brother of speech, and that brother resembles brother is not at all surprising."
     <br/>
     [N.B. The chorus of the primitive performances from which tragedy developed appeared as satyrs, clad in goat-skins. Hence the name
     <em>
      tragôidia
     </em>
     (goat-song). The adjective tragikos may mean either "goat-like" or "tragic." In this passage it has both meanings.]
