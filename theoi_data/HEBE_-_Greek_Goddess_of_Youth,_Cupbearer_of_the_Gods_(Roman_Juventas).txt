     HEBE was the goddess of youth and the cupbearer of the gods who served ambrosia at the heavenly feast. She was also the patron goddess of the young bride and an attendant of the goddess

      Aphrodite
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Herakles (Heracles) received Hebe in marriage upon his ascension to Olympos, a wedding which reconciled the hero with Hebe's mother Hera.
    </p>
    <p>
     In Greek vase painting Hebe was depicted either as the bride of Herakles, or the cupbearer of the gods, pouring ambrosia from a pitcher. Sometimes she had wings like the goddesses

     HEBE (Hêbê), the personification of youth, is described as a daughter of Zeus and Hera (Apollod. i. 3. § 1.), and is, according to the Iliad (iv. 2), the minister of the gods, who fills their cups with nectar; she assists Hera in putting the horses to her chariot (v. 722); and she bathes and dresses her brother Ares (v. 905). According to the Odyssey (xi. 603; comp. Hes.
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     950), she was married to Heracles after his apotheosis. Later traditions, however, describe her as having become by Heracles the mother of two sons, Alexiares and Anticetus (Apollod. ii. 7. § 7), and as a divinity who had it in her power to make persons of an advanced age young again. (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     ix. 400, &amp;c.) She was worshipped at Athens, where she had an altar in the Cynosarges, near one of Heracles. (Paus. i. 19. § 3.) Under the name of the female Ganymedes (Ganymeda) or Dia, she was worshipped in a sacred grove at Sicyon and Phlius. (Paus. ii. 13. § 3; Strab. viii. p. 382.)
    </p>
    <p>
     At Rome the goddess was worshipped under the corresponding name of Juventas, and that at a very early time, for her chapel on the Capitol existed before the temple of Jupiter was built there; and she, as well as Terminus, is said to have opposed the consecration of the temple of Jupiter. (Liv. v. 54.) Another temple of Juventas, in the Circus Maximus, was vowed by the consul M. Livius, after the defeat of Hasdrubal, in B. C. 207, and was consecrated 16 years afterwards. (Liv. xxxvi. 36 ; comp. xxi. 62; Dionys. iv. 15, where a temple of Juventas is mentioned as early as the reign of Servius Tullius; August.

And then at last Callirhoe Acheloia [daughter of Akhelous], for her infant sons shall beg those years [removed from Iolaos] from Jove [Zeus] on bended knee, to speed their vengeance for the victor's death.

The earliest Phliasians named the goddess to whom the sanctuary belongs Ganymeda; but later authorites call her Hebe, whom Homer mentions in the duel between Menelaos (Menelaus) and Alexandros (Alexander), saying that she was the cup-bearer of the gods; and again he says, in the descent of Odysseus to Haides, that she was the wife of Herakles. Olen [a legendary Greek poet], in his hymn to Hera, says that Hera was reared by the Horai (Horae, Seasons), and that her children were Ares and Hebe. Of the honours that the Phliasians pay to this goddess the greatest is the pardoning of suppliants. All those who seek sanctuary here receive full forgiveness, and prisoners, when set free, dedicate their fetters on the trees in the grove. The Phliasians also celebrate a yearly festival which they call
     <em>
      Kissotomoi

     (Ivy-cutters). There is no image, either kept in secret of openly displayed, and the reason for this is set forth in a sacred legend of theirs though on the left as you go out is a temple of Hera with an image of Parian marble."

     [Greek writer C3rd B.C.] says that there is a temple to Herakles (Heracles) and to his spouse [Hebe] whom poets celebrate as the daughter of Hera. Now they say that in the precincts of these temples a large number of tame birds are kept, adding that these birds are cockerels and hens. They feed and consort together according to their sex, are fed at the public expense, and are consecrated to the aforesaid gods. The hens feed in the temple of Hebe while their mates feed in the temple of Herakles. And a never-failing channel of clear water flows between them. Now on the one hand not a single hen ever appears in the temple of Herakles. On the other hand at the season of mating the cockerels fly across the channel and after consorting with the hens return to their own quarters at the side of the god whom they serve, cleansed by the water that separates the sexes. And so to begin with, as a natural result of this union eggs are laid; later on when the hens have warmed them and hatched the chicks, the cockerels carry off the male birds to rear them, while the hens make it their business to rear their daughters."

     JUVENTAS &amp; THE MONTH OF JUNE

      Ovid, Fasti 6. 65 ff (trans.Boyle) (Roman poetry C1st B.C. to C1st A.D.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "Hercules' [Herakles'] wife [Juventas-Hebe] stood there; life's bloom shimmered in her face. ‘If my mother [Juno-Hera] told me,’ she says, ‘to leave all heaven I would not stay against my mother's will. So now I will not fight her over this time's name [i.e. in a dispute over which goddess gave her name to the month of June], but coax and almost play petitioner. I'd rather keep my rights of possession by pleading, and perhaps my case might win your favour. Mother owns the golden Capitol [of Rome] with her joint shrine, and rightly holds the summit with Jove [Zeus]. But my whole glory comes from a month's origin; I am anxious for my only honour. Does it matter, Roman, that you gave Hercules' wife the month's name, and posterity remembers? This land owes me something, too, on my great husband's [Herakles'] account. He drove the captured cattle here, where Cacus found no defence in his father's [Hephaistos' (Hephaestus')] gift of flame and dyed Aventine dirt with blood. I pass to more recent times. Romulus divided the people by years into two sections: one was readier to give counsel, one to fight, one age advises war, one wages it. So he decreed and marked the months with the same token: June's for
     <em>
      JUNiors
     </em>
     , the seniors' month precedes.’
     <br/>
     She spoke. They would have hotly disputed the claim and cloaked family piety with wrath : Concordia (Harmony) [Harmonia] arrived [to settle the dispute]."
