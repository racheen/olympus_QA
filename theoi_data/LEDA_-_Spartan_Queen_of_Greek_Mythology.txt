   LEDA - Spartan Queen of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Leda was a queen of Sparta, the wife of King Tyndareus, who was seduced by Zeus in the guise of the swan. There were several versions of the parentage of her children. Some say she laid an egg from which were hatched the Dioscuri twins, Castor and Polydeuces, both sons of Zeus. Others say she laid two eggs each containing a child of Zeus and a child of Tyndareus--Polydeuces and Castor in one, and Helene and Clytemnestra in the other." name="description"/>

     LEDA was a queen of Sparta, the wife of King Tyndareus, who was seduced by Zeus in the guise of the swan. There were several versions of the parentage of her children:-
     <br/>
     Some say she laid an egg from which were hatched the Dioskouroi (Dioscuri) twins, Kastor and Polydeukes, both sons of Zeus.
     <br/>
     Others say she laid two eggs each containing a child of Zeus and a child of Tyndareus--Polydeukes and Kastor in one, and Helene and Klytaimnestra (Clytemnestra) in the other.
     <br/>
     Yet others relate that the second egg, containing just Helene, was delivered to Leda by the goddess
     <a href="../Daimon/Nemesis.html">
      Nemesis
     </a>
     who had lain it after coupling with Zeus in the guise of a goose.
    </p>
    <h3>
     CHRONOLOGY OF MYTH
    </h3>
    <p>
     In the chronology of myth Leda was a contemporary of Herakles who placed her husband Tyndareus on the throne of Sparta. Her Dioskouroi sons joined the expedition of the Argonauts and the Kalydonian Boar Hunt--albeit at a very young age--while her daughters Helene and Klytaimnestra were the wives of Trojan War heroes.
     <br/>
     In ancient Greek vase painting the generation gap between the sons and daughters of Leda was sometimes illustrated--with the full-grown DIoskouroi standing witness as Helene hatches from the egg. In myth the twins also led an army to Athens when Theseus kidnapped their ten year old sister.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leda was usually described as a daughter of Thestios, king of Pleuron. Her sister Althaia was the mother of the Kalydonian hero Meleagros (Meleager). Thestios himself was a grandson of Aitolos (Aetolus), son of the famed

     .

     LEDA (Lêda), a daughter of Thestius, whence she is called Thestias (Apollod. iii. 10. § 5; Paus. iii. 13. § 8; Eurip.
     <em>

     <em>
      Od.
     </em>

     77.) According to Homer (

     xi. 298, &amp;c.) both Castor and Polydeuces were sons of Tyndareus and Leda, while Helena is described as a daughter of Zeus. (

     <em>
      Iph. Aul.
     </em>
     50), and that, according to Lactantius (i. 21.), Leda was after her death raised to the rank of a divinity, under the name of Nemesis.

But some say that Helene was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helene was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter."

     <em>
      ornis

     , the general term for bird. This reason for the name has been handed down : When Jupiter [Zeus], moved by desire, had begun to love Nemesis, and couldn't persuade her to lie with him, he relieved his passion by the following plan. He bade Venus [Aphrodite], in the form of an eagle, pursue him; he, changed to a swan, as if in flight from the eagle, took refuge with Nemesis and lighted in her lap. Nemesis did not thrust him away, but holding him in her arms, fell into a deep sleep. While she slept, Jupiter embraced her, and then flew away. Because he was seen by men flying high in the sky, they said he was put in the stars. To make this really true, Jupiter put the swan flying and the eagle pursuing in the sky.
     <br/>
     But Nemesis, as if wedded to the tribe of birds, when her months were ended, bore an egg. Mercurius [Hermes] took it away and carried it to Sparta and threw it in Leda's lap. From it sprang Helen, who excelled all other girls in beauty. Leda called her her own daughter.
     <br/>

     "The Fable of the Swan and Leda. Although love of lust is shameful in all men, yet it is never worse than when it is involved with honor. For lust in relation to honor, not knowing what it sets in motion, is always opposed to dignity. He who seeks what he wishes to be something so divine must beware lest it become what it had not been. For Jove [Zeus] disguised as a swan lay with Leda, who laid an egg from which were born the three, Castor, Pollux, and Helen of Troy.
     <br/>
     This legend carries the flavour of an allegorical interpretation, for Jove is explained as the symbol of power, and Leda is for
     <em>
      lide
     </em>
     , which in Latin we call either insult or reviling. Thus all power getting involved with insults changes the appearance of its magnanimity. He is said to have changed into a swan because the naturalists, particularly Melistus of Euboea who has expounded the meanings of all the natural scientists, declare that a bird of this species is so filled with reviling that when this bird clamors the rest of the birds nearby become silent. For this reason it is also called an
     <em>
      olor
     </em>
     , as if derived from
     <em>
      oligoria
     </em>
     , necessarily involved with insults. But let us see what is produced from this affair, no less than an egg, for, just as in an egg, all the dirt which is to be washed away at birth is retained inside, so too in the work of reviling everything is impurity. But from this egg are born the three, Castor, Pollux, and Helen, nothing less than a seedbed of scandal and strife, as I once wrote : ‘And the adulteress shatters both worlds with grief.’ For they explain Castor and Pollux as symbols of destruction, whence they explain the signs (
     <em>
      signa
     </em>
     ) of the Castors in the sea as creating peril; they say that both of them rise up and fall down alternately, because pride always commands but always falls; whereby in Greek
     <em>
      iperefania
     </em>
     is the word for pride.
     <em>
      Iperefania
     </em>
     is strictly the term for appearance above, because, in those two constellations which they call by the name of the brothers, once appears above and the other sinks down, like Lucifer and Antifer; for in Greek Pollux is
     <em>
      apo tu apollin
     </em>
     , that is, seeking to destroy, and Castor is for
     <em>
      cacon steron
     </em>
     , that is, final evil." [N.B. The faux etymologies have been constructed according to the author's tastes.]
