   SILENUS (Seilenos) - Greek God of Drunkenness &amp; Wine-Making
  </title>
  <meta content="Silenus was the ancient Greek god of wine-making and drunkenness. He was the foster-father of the god Dionysus who was entrusted to his care by Hermes after his birth from the thigh of Zeus. The young god was raised by Silenus and nursed by the Nysiad nymphs in a cave on Mount Nysa. He was depicted as a jovial old man, hairy and balding, with a pot-belly, snub-nose, and the ears and tail of an ass." name="description"/>

    <p>
     SEILENOS (Silenus) was the old rustic god of wine-making and drunkenness.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was the foster-father of the god
     <a href="../Olympios/Dionysos.html">
      Dionysos
     </a>
     who was entrusted to his care by Hermes after his birth from the thigh of Zeus. The young god was raised by Seilenos and nursed by the
     <a href="../Nymphe/NymphaiNysiades.html">
      Nysiad
     </a>
     nymphs in a cave on Mount Nysa.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once, when Dionysos was travelling through Phrygia, Seilenos became lost and was captured by King Midas. The king treated him hospitably and as a reward Dionysos granted him his golden touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seilenos was the father or grandfather of the tribes of
     <a href="Satyroi.html">
      Satyroi
     </a>
     (Satyrs) and
     <a href="../Nymphe/Nymphai.html">
      Nymphs
     </a>
     . He was sometimes multiplied into a triad or large band of
     <a href="Seilenoi.html">
      Seilenoi (Silens)
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Seilenos was depicted as a jovial old man, hairy and balding, with a pot-belly, snub-nose, and the ears and tail of an ass. He rode in the train of Dionysos seated on the back of a donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
     Seilenos was, in essence, the spirit  of the treading dance of the wine-press, his name being derived from the words
     <em>
      seiô
     </em>
     , "to move to and fro," and
     <em>
      lênos
     </em>
     , "the wine-trough."
    </p>
    <p>
     Seilenos was closely identified with a number of other minor rustic divinities. These include:--
     <a href="Hekateros.html">
      Hekateros (Hecaterus)
     </a>
     , grandfather of the Satyroi (Satyrs) and Oreiades (Oreads);
     <a href="SeilenosNysos.html">
      Nysos
     </a>
     and
     <a href="../Potamos/PotamosLamos.html">
      Lamos
     </a>
     , alternate foster-fathers of Dionysos;
     <a href="Aristaios.html">
      Aristaios (Aristaeus)
     </a>
     , god of shepherds, and another foster-father of Dionysos;
     <a href="OrosOreios.html">
      Oreios (Oreus)
     </a>
     , father of the Hamadryades;
     <a href="KouretePyrrhikhos.html">
      Pyrrhikhos (Pyrrhichus)
     </a>
     , a Kourete (Curete) of the rustic dance; and
     <a href="SatyrosMarsyas.html">
      Marsyas
     </a>
     , a flute-playing satyr.

    <p>
     SILE′NUS or SEILE′NUS (Seilênos). It is remarked in the article Satyrus, that the older Satyrs were generally termed Sileni (comp. Schol.
     <em>
      ad Nicand. Alex. 31
     </em>
     ), but one of these Sileni is commonly
     <em>
      the
     </em>
     Silenus, who always acts a prominent part in the retinue of Dionysus, from whom he is inseparable, and whom he is said to have brought up and instructed. (Diod. iv. 14; Orph.
     <em>
      Hymn. 53. 1.
     </em>
     ) Like the other Satyrs he is called a son of Hermes (Serv.
     <em>
      ad Virg. Eclog.
     </em>
     vi. 13), but others call him a son of Pan by a nymph, or of Gaea (Nonn.
     <em>
      Dionys.
     </em>
     xiv. 97, xxix. 262; Aelian,
     <em>
      V. H.
     </em>
     iii. 18; comp. Porphyr.
     <em>
      Vit. Pythag. 16 ;
     </em>
     Clemens,
     <em>
      Cohort. ad Gent.
     </em>
     p. 24.) Being the constant companion of Dionysus, he is, like the god, said to have been born at Nysa (Catull. 64, 253), and Diodorus (iii. 72) even represents him as king of Nysa ; he moreover took part in the contest with the Gigantes, and slew Enceladus, putting the others to flight by the braying of his ass. (Eurip.
     <em>
      Cycl.
     </em>
     ) He is described as a jovial old man, with a bald head, a puck nose, fat and round like his wine bag, which he always carried with him, and generally as intoxicated. As therefore he cannot trust to his own legs, he is generally riding on an ass (Ov.
     <em>
      Fast.
     </em>
     i. 399, iii. 749), or he is supported by other Satyrs and Satyrisci. (Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     vi. 13 ; Lucian,
     <em>
      Deor. Cone. 4.
     </em>
     ) In every other respect he is described as resembling his brethren in the fondness for sleep, wine and music. He is mentioned along with Marsyas and Olympus as the inventor of the flute which he is often seen playing (Strab. x. p. 470), and a special kind of dance was called after him Silenus, while he himself is designated as the dancer. (Anacr. 38. 11; Paus. iii. 25. § 2; Lucian,
     <em>
      Icarom. 27.
     </em>
     ) But it is a peculiar feature in his character that he was conceived also as an inspired prophet, who knew all the past and the most distant future (Aelian,
     <em>
      V. H.
     </em>
     iii. 18; Virg.
     <em>
      Eclog.
     </em>
     vi, 31, &amp;c.), and as a sage who despised all the gifts of fortune (Cic.
     <em>
      Tuscul.
     </em>
     i. 48); so that he becomes the representative of that wisdom which conceals itself behind a rough and uncouth external appearance, whence he is likened to Socrates. (Plat.
     <em>
      Sympos. 32 ;
     </em>
     Xenoph.
     <em>
      Sympos. 5 § 7.
     </em>
     ) When he was drunk and asleep, he was in the power of mortals who might compel him to prophesy and sing by surrounding him with chains of flowers. (Aelian,
     <em>
      V. H.
     </em>
     iii. 18; Philostr.
     <em>
      Imag.
     </em>
     i. 22,
     <em>
      Vit. Apoll.
     </em>
     vi. 27; Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xi. 91.) Silenus had a temple at Elis, where Methe (Drunkenness) stood by his side handing him a cup of wine.

     Midas. The Satyros (Satyr) [i.e. Seilenos (Silenus)] is asleep; let us speak of him with bated breath, lest he wake and spoil the scene before us. Midas has captured him with wine in Phrygia on the very mountain-side, as you see, by filling with wine the spring beside which he lies disgorging the wine in his sleep.

     Charming is the vehemence of Satyroi (Satyrs) when they dance, and charming their ribaldry when they laugh; they are given to live, noble creatures that they are, and they subdue the Lydian women to their will by their artful flatteries. And this too is true of them: they are represented in paintings as hardy, hot-blooded beings, with prominent ears, lean about the loins, altogether mischievous, and having the tails of horses.
     <br/>
     The Satyros caught by Midas is here depicted as Satyroi in general are, but he is asleep as a result of the wine, breathing heavily like a drunken man. He has drunk up the whole spring more easily than another would have taken a cupful, and the Nymphai (Nymphs) dance, mocking the Satyros for having fallen asleep. How dainty is Midas and how he takes his ease! He is careful of his head-dress and his curling locks, and he carries a thyrsos and wears a robe woven with gold."

     "I have a remedy against these hell-hounds [i.e. satyrs, or African apes], which Midas is said once to have employed; for Midas himself had some of the blood of Satyroi (Satyrs) in his veins, as was clear from the shape of his ears; and a Satyros [i.e. Seilenos (Silenus)] once, trespassing on his kinship with Midas, made merry at the expense of his ears, not only singing about them, but piping about them. Well, Midas, I understand, had heard from his mother that when a Satyros is overcome by wine he falls asleep, and at such times comes to his senses and will make friends with you; so he mixed wine which he had in his palace in a fountain and led the Satyros get at it, and the latter drank it up and was overcome. And to show that the story is true, let us go to the head man of the village, and if the villagers have any wine, we will mix it with water for the Satyros and he will share the fate of Midas' Satyros."

For the peasants of Phryges (Phrygia) had caught the old man, tottering along muddled with wine and years, and crowned his head with country flowers and brought him to their king, Midas, whom Orpheus Thracius (the Thracian) and Eumolpus Cecropius once had taught the Bacchic rites. He recognised his old companion of the Mysteries, and for his guest made merry in a feast for ten great days on end and nights to match; then on the eleventh morning Lucifer [Hesperos] marshalled the starry host to leave the sky, and Midas came to Lydia, light at heart, bringing Silenus back to his young ward. Liber [Dionysos], rejoicing in the safe return of old Silenus (once his guardian), granted the king to choose his heart's desire, a choice that seemed a boon, but proved a bane. So Midas chose, a sorry choice : ‘Ordain that everything I touch shall turn to gold.’ The god indulged his wish, gave the reward, dire as it was, and mourned a choice so bad."

     </span>
     <br/>
     [The following tale of Seilenos' (Silenus') transformation into a river is a variant of the Marysas myth. Just like Marsyas, Seilenos is defeated in a contest and transformed into a river .]
     <br/>
     "When he [Dionysos] had ended his speech [declaring a dancing competition at the funeral of Staphylos (Staphylus) a king and friend of Dionysos], up rose horned Seilenos (Silenus), and antediluvian Maron got up on heavy foot, with his eyes on the great mixer of shining gold [offered as prize]: not because the golden was the better, but because this alone contained the oldest wine and the finest stuff, filling it to the brim . . . [Maron dances first in the contest followed by Seilenos.]
     <br/>
     Now Seilenos danced: his hand without speech traced the cues of his art in all their intricate mazes. This is what he acted with gesturing hands: how once a great quarrel arose between Kyrene's (Cyrene's) son [Aristaios (Aristaeus)] and Dionysos over their cups, and the Blessed gathered together. There was no boxing, no running, no quoit in that contest: cups were the well-used tools ready for Phoibos's son and Dionysos, and a couple of mixingbowls, one containing old wine, one with the gift of the sprigloving bee all fresh . . .
     <br/>
     So horned Seilenos wove his web with neat-handed skill, and his right hand ceased to move. Then fixing his gaze on the sky, he leapt into the air with bounding shoe. Now he clapt both feet together, then parted them, and went hopping from foot to foot; now over the floor he twirled dancing round and round upright upon his heels and spun in a circling sweep. He stood steady on his right foot holding a toe of the other foot, or bent his knee and caught it in his clasping hands, or held an outstretched thigh with the other leg upright, the heavyknee Seilenos! He lifted the left foot coiling up to the side, to the shoulder, twining it behind him and holding it up until he brought the sole round his neck. Then with a quick turn of the back-swerving dance, he artfully bent himself over, face up, in a hoop, showing his belly spread out and curved up towards the sky, while he spun round and round on one unchanging spot. His head hung down as he moved, as if it were always touching the ground and yet not grazing the dust. So Seilenos went scratching the ground with hairy foot, restlessly moving round and round in his wild caperings.
     <br/>
     At last his knees failed him; with shaking head he slipt to the ground and rolled over on his back. At once he became a river: his body was flowing water with natural ripples all over, his forehead changed to a winding current with the horns for waves, the turbulent swell came to a crest on his head, his belly sank into the sand, a deep place for fishes. As Seilenos lay spread, his hair changed into natural rushes, and over the river his pipes made a shrill tune of themselves as the breezes touched them.
     <br/>
     But Maron crowned himself with the sweets of victory, and held in his arms the mixer stuffed with delicious wine; he took the silver bowl, the prize of Seilenos now a flood, and threw it into the river as a libation, where it intoxicated the currents of the dancing river. And so the place was named from the Mixer, and men still speak of the Euian water of murmuring Seilenos full of sweet drink. Then Maron addressed these words to the running stream : ‘Maron does you no harm, Seilenos. I will cast the ruddy wine into you and call you the Cellarer. Accept your drink, tippler never satisfied, accept the silver bowl of Bakkhos (Bacchus), and you shall have silvery eddies. Seilenos Twirlthefoot, you dance even in your current, you keep the spinning of your feet even in your waves, you revel still in your watery shape. Then be gracious to the Bakkhantes (Bacchantes) and Satyroi (Satyrs) and winegiving vintage, and guard the Seilenoi (Silens) your own race. Be generous to Maron who drinks no heeltaps, and let me never see that you still keep a secret grudge among the rivers. Rather let your waters increase the wine of Maron's vintage, and be done of one mind with Dionysos even among rivers. Foolish one, who taught you to strive with your betters? Another Seilenos (Silen) there was [Marsyas], fingering a proud pipe, who lifted a haughty neck and challenged a match with Phoibos (Phoebus) [Apollon]; but Phoibos tied him to a tree and stript off his hairy skin, and made it a windbag . . .So you also have changed your shape by challenging one better than you, just like the earlier Seilenos. You must no longer seek a barefoot Bakkhante for your bride as before, that Bakkhante of the mountains with flowing locks; you have now for your pleasure the innumerable tribe of Naiades with flowing hair. Seek no longer the snaky wreaths of Lyaios; eels are what you have to do with, the wriggling travail of streams, and instead of serpent there ware fishes with closefitted speckled scales crawling in your streams. And if you have parted from Dionysos and his grapes, I hold you the happier; for you really make the grapes to grow! What more could you want, when you have after Bakkhos now Zeus to feed your streams, the Father of all creation? Instead of your Satyroi you have your regiments of Rivers; instead of the winepress you dance on the back of murmuring Okeanos (Oceanus). Even in the waters you are like what you were; it is proper that Seilenos, once proud of his horned forehead, as a River should have the horned shape of a bull.’
     <br/>
     So Maron spoke; and all wondered to see the winding waters of Seilenos the tumbling flood, the ever-turning river which was his very likeness."
