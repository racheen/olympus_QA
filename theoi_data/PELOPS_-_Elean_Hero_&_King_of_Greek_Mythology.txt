   PELOPS - Elean Hero &amp; King of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Pelops was a king of the Elean city of Pisa and the eponymous overlord of the western Peloponnesos--the so-called Island of Pelops. The young Pelops came to Greece from Lydia to compete for the hand of Hippodamia, daughter of King Oenomaus of Pisa. The king would slay his daughter's suitors as he overtook them in a chariot race, so Pelops bribed the charioteer Myrtilus to tamper with the axle. Oenomaus was killed as a result and Pelops seized control of the kingdom. When Myrtilus demanded his reward, he treacherously cast him off a cliff into the sea. The dying man called down a curse upon his house which would plague Pelops and his descendants for many generations to come." name="description"/>

    <p>
     PELOPS was  a king of the Eleian city of Pisa and the eponymous overlord of the western Peloponnesos, the so-called "Island of Pelops".
    </p>
    <p>
     His father King Tantalos of Lydia was impious man who, wishing to test the fallibility of the gods, butchered the young Pelops and served him at a feast of the gods.
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     recognised the deception, cast Tantalos into Haides for eternal torment, and had the boy resurrected by the
     <a href="../Daimon/Moirai.html">
      Moirai
     </a>
     . The Fates collected up his remains and cast them into a boiling cauldron, restoring his form except for his left shoulder which had inadvertently been devoured by the goddess
     <a href="../Olympios/Demeter.html">
      Demeter
     </a>
     . This they replaced with one made of ivory.
    </p>
    <p>
     The young Pelops became a lover of the god
     <a href="../Olympios/Poseidon.html">
      Poseidon
     </a>
     who provided him with a chariot drawn by swift--some say winged--horses. He later travelled across the sea to Greece to compete for the hand of Hippodameia, daughter of  King Oinomaos (Oenomaus) of Pisa. The king would slay  his daughter's suitors as he overtook them in a chariot race, so Pelops bribed the charioteer Myrtilos to tamper with the axle. Oinomaos was killed as a result and Pelops seized control of the kingdom. When Myrtilos demanded his reward, he treacherously cast him off a cliff into the sea. The dying man called down a curse upon his house which would plague Pelops and his descendants for many generations to come.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pelops quickly grew his empire and came to control most of the western Peloponnesos. His rival in the east was King Perseus of Argos, but the two houses formed an alliance with the marriage of the daughters of Pelops to the sons of Perseus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pelops was one of the most important founding-kings of myth. His descendants included Herakles, Eurystheus, Theseus, Atreus, Agamemnon and Menelaus.

     PELOPS (Pelops), a grandson of Zeus and son of Tantalus and Dione, the daughter of Atlas. (Hygin.

     83; Eurip.

     init.) As he was thus a great-grandson of Cronos, he is called by Pindar Kronios (
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     iii. 41), though it may also contain an allusion to Pluto, the mother of Tantalus, who was a daughter of Cronos. Some writers call the mother of Pelops Euryanassa or Clytia. (Schol.
     <em>

     52; comp. Apostol.
     <em>

     </em>
     xviii. 7.) He was married to Hippodameia, by whom he became the father of Atreus (Letreus, Paus. vi. 22. § 5), Thyestes, Dias, Cynosurus, Corinthus, Hippalmus (Hippalcmus or Hippalcimus), Hippasus, Cleon, Argeius, Alcathus, Aelius, Pittheus, Troezen, Nicippe and Lysidice. (Apollod. ii. 4. § 5; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Orest.
     </em>
     5.) By Axioche or the nymph Danais he is said to have been the father of Chrysippus (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. l.c. ;
     </em>
     Plut.
     <em>
      Parall. min.
     </em>
     33), and according to Pindar (i. 89) he had only six sons by Hippodanieia, whereas the Scholiast (
     <em>
      ad Ol.
     </em>
     i. 144) mentions Pleisthenes and Chrysippus as sons of Pelops by Hippodaineia. Further, while the common accounts mention only the two daughters above named, Plutarch (
     <em>
      Thes.
     </em>
     3) speaks of many daughters of Pelops.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pelops was king of Pisa in Elis, and from him the great southern peninsula of Greece was believed to have derived its name Peloponnesus; the nine small islands, moreover, which were situated off the Troezenian coast, opposite Methana, are said to have been called after hint the Pelopian islands. (Paus. ii. 34. § 4.) According to a tradition which becmne very general in later times. Pelops was a Phrygian, who was expelled from Sipylus by Ilus (Paus. ii. 22. § 4, v. 13. § 4), whereupon the exile then came witl his great wealth to Pisa (v. 1. § 5 ; Thuc. i. 9; comp. Sophl.
     <em>
      Ajax,
     </em>
     1292; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     i. 36, ix. 15); others describe him as a Paphlagonian, and call him an Eneteian, from the Paphlagonian town of Enete, and the Paphlagonians theimselves Pelopêïoi (Apollon. Rhod. ii. 358, with the Schol., and 790; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     i. 37 ; Diod. iv. 74), while others again represent him as a native of Greece, who came from Olenos in Achaia. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. l. c.
     </em>
     ) Some, further, call him an Arcadian, and state that by a stratagem he slew the Arcadian king Stymphalus, and scattered about the limbs of his body which he had cut to pieces. (Apollod. iii. 12. § 6.) There can be little doubt that in the earliest and most genuine traditions, Pelops was described as a native of Greece and not as a foreign immigrant; and in them he is called the tamer of horses and the favourite of Poseidon. (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ii. 104; Paus. v. 1. §5, 8. § 1; Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     i. 38.)
    </p>
    <p>
     The legends about Pelops consist mainly of the story of his being cut to pieces and boiled, and of the tuole concerning his contest with Oenomaus and Hippodameia, to which may be added the legends about his relation to his sons and about his remains.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Pelops cut to pieces and boiled.
     </em>
     (Kreourgia Pelopos.) Tantalus, the favourite of the gods, it is said, once invited them to a repast, and on that occasion he slaughtered his own son, and having boiled him set the flesh before them that they might eat it. But the immortal gods, knowing what it was, did not touch it; Demeter alone being absorbed by her grief about her lost daughter (others mentioned Thetis, Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     i. 37), consumed the shoulder of Pelops. Hereupon the gods ordered Hermes to put the limbs of Pelops into a cauldron, and thereby restore to him his life and former appearance. When the process was over, Clotho took him out of the cauldron, and as the shoulder consumed by Demeter was wanting, Demeter supplied its place by one made of ivory ; his descendants (the Pelopidae), as a mark of their origin, were believed to have one shoulder as white as ivory. (Pind.

     </em>
     vi. 404.) This story is not related by all authors in the same manner, for according to some, Rhea restored Pelops, and Pan, the companion of Rhea, danced on the occasion. (Schol.
     <em>

     <em>
      De Saltlt.
     </em>
     54; Paus. v. 13. §4.) Pindar. again, denies the story of the kreourgia, and states that Poseidon, being in love with the beautiful boy Pelops, carried him off, whereupon Pelops, like Ganymedes, for a time stayed with the gods. (

    <p>
     <em>
      Contest with Oenomaus and Hippodameia.
     </em>
     As an oracle had declared to Oenomaus that he should be killed by his son-in-law, he refused giving his fair daughter Hippodameia in marriage to any one. (Some said that he himself was in love with his daughter, and for this reason refused to give her to any one; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     156; Lucian,
     <em>

     </em>
     19 ; Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     253.) Many suitors however, appearing, Oenomnaus declared that he would give her to him, who should conquer him in the chariot-race, but that he should kill those that should be conquered by him. Among other suitors Pelops also presented himself, but when he saw the heads of his conquered predecessors stuck up above the door of Oenomaus, he was seized with fear, and endeavoured to gain the favour of Myrtilus, the chiarioteer of Oenomaus, promising him half the kingdom if he would assist him in gaining Hippodameeia. Myrtilus agreed, and did not properly fasten the wheels to the chariot of Oenomaus. so that he might be upset during the race. The plan succeeded, and Oenomans dying pronounced a curse upon Myrtilus. When Pelops returned home with Hippodameia and Myrtilus, he resolved to throw the latter into the sea. As Myrtilus sank, he cursed Pelops and his whole race. (Hygiin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     84; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     i. 114; Diod. iv. 73 ; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 183.) This story too is related with various modifications. According to Pindar, Pelops did not gain the victory by any stratagem, but called for assistance upon Poseidon, wllo gave him a chariot and horses by which he overcame Oenomaus. (
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     i. 109, &amp;c.) On the chest of Cypselus where the race was represented, the horses had wings. (Paus. v. 17. § 4; comp. Apollon. Rhod. i. 752, &amp;c.) In order to atone for the murder of Myrtilus, Pelops founded the first temple of Hermes in Peloponnesus (Paus. v. 15. § 5), and he also erected a monument to the unsuccessful suitors of Hippodameia, at which an annual sacrifice was offered to them (vi. 21. § 7). When Pelops had gained possession of Hippodameia, he went with her to Pisa in Elis, and soon also made himself master of Olympia, where he restored the Olympian games with greater splendour than they had ever had before. (Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     ix. 16; Paus. v. 1. § 5, 8. § 1.) He received his sceptre from Hermes and bequeathed it to Atreus. (Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     ii. 104.)
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The sons of Pelops.
     </em>
     Chrysippus who was the favourite of his father, roused the envy of his brothers, who in concert with Hippodameia, prevailed upon the two eldest among them, Atreus and Thyestes, to kill Chrysippus. They accomplished their crime, and threw the body of their murdered brother into a well. According to some Atreus alone was the murderer (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Orest.
     </em>
     800), or Pelops himself killed him (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Thuc.
     </em>
     i. 9), or Chrysippus made away with himself (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Phocn.
     </em>
     1760), or Hippodameia slew him, because her own sons refused to do it. (Plut.
     <em>
      Parall. Min.
     </em>
     33.) According to the common tradition, however, Pelops, who suspected his sons of the murder, expelled them from the country, and they dispersed all over Peloponnesus. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Or.
     </em>
     5; Paus. v. 8. § 1.) Hippodameia, dreading the anger of her husband, fled to Midea in Argolis. from whence her remains were afterwards conveyed by Pelops, at the command of an oracle, to Olympia. (Paus. vi. 20. § 4.) Some state that Hippodameia made away with herself. (Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     85, 243.) She had a sanctuary at Olympia in the grove Altis, to which women alone had access, and in the race course at Olympia there was a bronze statue of her. (Paus. vi. 20. § 10.)
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The remains of Pelops.
     </em>
     While the Greeks were engaged in the siege of Troy, they were informed by an oracle, that the city could not be taken, unless one of the bones of Pelops were brought from Elis to Troas. The shoulder bone accordingly was fetched from Letrina or Pisa, but was lost together with the ship in which it was carried, off the coast of Euboea. Many years afterwards it was dragged up from the bottom of the sea by a fisherman, Demarmenus of Eretria, who concealed it in the sand, and then consulted the Delphic oracle about it. At Delphi he met ambassadors of the Eleians, who had come to consult the oracle respecting a plague, which was raging in their country. The Pythia requested Demarmenus to give the shoulder bone of Pelops to the Eleians. This was done accordingly, and the Eleians appointed Demarmenus to guard the venerable relic. (Paus. v. 13. § 3; Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lyc.
     </em>
     52, 54.) According to some the Palladium was made of the bones of Pelops. (Clem. Alex.
     <em>
      ad Gent.
     </em>
     p. 30, d; cosmp. Plin.
     <em>
      H. N.
     </em>
     xxviii. 4.) Pelops was honoured at Olympia above all other heroes. (Paus. v. 13. § 1.) His tomb with an iron sarcophagus existed on the banks of the Alpheius, not far from the temple of Artemis near Pisa; and every year the ephebi there scourged themselves, shedding their blood as a funeral sacrifice to the hero. (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     i. 146.) The spot on which his sanctuary (Pelopion) stood in the grove Altis, was said to have been dedicated by Heracles, who also offered to him the first sacrifices. (Paus.
     <em>
      l. c. ;
     </em>
     v. 26, in fin.; Apollod. ii. 7. § 2.) The magistrates of the Eleians likewise offered to him there an annual sacrifice, consisting of a black ram, with special ceremonies. (Paus. v. 13. § 2.) His chariot was shown in the temple of Demeter at Phlius, and his sword in the treasury of the Sicyonians at Olympia. (Paus. ii. 14. § 3, vi. 19. §3.)

     TANTALUS, PELOPS &amp; THE CANNIBAL-FEAST OF THE GODS
    </h3>
    <p>
     <span class="quote-greek">
      Pindar, Olympian Ode 1. 24 ff (trans. Conway) (Greek lyric C5th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[Pisa] the colony of Lydian Pelops, that land of noble souls . . . Pelops, who stirred Poseidon's love, the god of mighty strength, the earth-holder, when Klotho (Clotho) [one of the Moirai (Fates)] drew him from the untainted bowl, his shoulder shod with gleaming ivory. True, there are many marvels; here or there maybe the tongues of men o'er-riding truth's sure word, deceive with false-spun tales, the embroidery of lies . . . Right is it a man speak well of the immortals, less then will be his blame. Tantalos' (Tantalus') son, unlike to bards of old, my tongue shall tell how when your father gave the all-seemly banquet, on Sipylos (Sipylus) that he loved, to make return of hospitable gift to the immortals, then he of the Bright Trident [Poseidon] seized upon you, his heard mad with desire, and brought you mounted in his glorious chariot to the high hall of Zeus whom all men honour, where later came Ganymedes, too, for a like love, to Zeus.
     <br/>
     But when you were thus vanished with no sign, and the wide search of men had brought you not back to your mother, then quickly was heard some secret voice of envious neighbours, telling that for the seething cauldron's fiery heat your limbs with a knife's blade were cut asunder, and at each table, portioned to the guests, the morsels of your flesh became their meal.
     <br/>
     Senseless, I hold it, for a man to say the gods eat mortal flesh. I spurn the thought. A slanderer's evil tongue often enough brings him to no good end. But if indeed any man ever won honour from Olympos' lords, that man was Tantalos. Yet could he not stomach his high fortune, but earned for his excess a doom o'erwhelming, when the Father [Zeus] poised a mighty stone above him, which with its ever-threatening blow to strike his head,  . . . for that he stole from the immortals, and gave to his companions in revelry, ambrosia and nectar, whereby the gods gave him undying life . . . 
  Thence was it the gods sent his son [Pelops] down again to share the short-lived span of mortal life." [N.B. Pindar's story continues with the tale of the contest for Hippodameia (see below).]

     <br/>
     "When the flower of rising youth shaded his [Pelops'] cheek with down, then for a speedy marriage he counseled in his mind, from her father of Pisa to win the maid Hippodameia, of glorious fame. And coming near to the salt sea's edge, alone at night, he called aloud to the loud-roaring Wielder of the Trident [Poseidon], who came, and stood before him. Then spoke Pelops, and said ‘Lo, great Poseidon, if in your count Kypris' (Cypris') [Aphrodite's] gifts find aught of favour, then shackle Oinomaos' (Oenomaus') brazen spear, and bring me on speeding chariot wheels to the land of Elis, and grant me victory. For thirteen souls now has he slain, her suitors, and holds back the marriage of his daughter. Great danger calls to no coward's heard; but for man, who must die, why should he nurse a nameless old age through, in vain, in darkness, and of all deeds that glorious are have not a share? But for me shall this contest lie for my challenge. Do thou but grant fair issue my heart's desire.’
     <br/>
     So he spoke, and his prayer uttered no words that failed of their achievement. But for his glory's honour, the god gave him a gleaming chariot and steeds that flew unwearied upon wings.
     <br/>
     And mighty Oinomaos he slew, and took the maiden for his bride; six sons she bore, chieftains leading the field in valorous deeds. By Alpheios' (Alpheus') ford he lies now, closely joined to the great feast of glorious sacrifice, his tomb oft visited, beside the altar where many a stranger treads. And the great fame of the Olympiad Games shines far afield, in the course known of Pelops, where are matched rivals in sped of foot and in brave feats of bodily strength."

     <br/>
     "[Pelops] on account of his surpassing beauty he became a minion of Poseidon, who gave him a winged chariot, such that even when it ran through the sea the axles were not wet.
     <br/>
     Now Oinomaos (Oenomaus), the king of Pisa, had a daughter Hippodameia, and whether it was that he loved her, as some say, or that he was warned by an oracle that he must die by the man that married her, no man got her to wife; for her father could not persuade her to cohabit with him, and her suitors were put by him to death. For he had arms and horses given him by Ares, and he offered as a prize to the suitors the hand of his daughter, and each suitor was bound to take up Hippodameia on his own chariot and flee as far as the Isthmos of Korinthos (Corinth), and Oinomaos straightway pursued him, in full armour, and if he overtook him he slew him; but if the suitor were not overtaken, he was to have Hippodameia to wife. And in this way he slew many suitors, some say twelve; and he cut off the heads of the suitors and nailed them to his house.
     <br/>
     So Pelops also came a-wooing; and when Hippodameia saw his beauty, she conceived a passion for him, and persuaded Myrtilos (Myrtilus), son of Hermes, to help him; for Myrtilos was charioteer to Oinomaos. Accordingly Myrtilos, being in love with her and wishing to gratify her, did not insert the linchpins in the boxes of the wheels, and thus caused Oinomaos to lose the race and to be entangled in the reins and dragged to death; but according to some, he was killed by Pelops. And in dying he cursed Myrtilos, whose treachery he had discovered, praying that he might perish by the hand of Pelops.
     <br/>
     Pelops, therefore, got Hippodameia; and on his journey, in which he was accompanied by Myrtilos, he came to a certain place, and withdrew a little to fetch water for his wife, who was athirst; and in the meantime Myrtilos tried to rape her. But when Pelops learned that from her, he threw Myrtilos into the sea, called after him the Myrtoan Sea, at Cape Geraistos (Geraestus); and Myrtilos, as he was being thrown, uttered curses against the house of Pelops.
     <br/>
     When Pelops had reached Okeanos (Oceanus) and been cleansed by Hephaistos (Hephaestus), he returned to Pisa in Elis and succeeded to the kingdom of Oinomaos, but not till he had subjugated what was formerly called Apia and Pelasgiotis, which he called Peloponnesos (Peloponnese) after himself. The sons of Pelops were Pittheus, Atreus, Thyestes, and others."

     "Now that we have examined these matters we shall endeavour to set forth the facts concerning Pelops and Tantalos (Tantalus) and Oinomaos (Oenomaus), but to do so we must revert to earlier times and give in summary the whole story from the beginning. The account runs like this: In the city of Pisa in the Peloponnesos Ares lay with Harpinê (Harpina), the daughter of Asopos, and begat Oinomaos. Who, in turn, begat a daughter, an only child, and named her Hippodameia. And once when he consulted an oracle about the end of his life the god replied to him that he should die whenever his daughter Hippodameia should marry. Consequently, we are told, he proceeded cautiously regarding the marriage of his daughter and decided to see that she was kept a virgin, assuming that only in this way could he escape from the danger which her marriage would entail.
     <br/>
     And so, since there were many suitors for the girl's hand, he proposed a contest for any who wished to marry her, the conditions being that the defeated suitor must die, but whoever should win would have the girl in marriage. The contest he set was a chariot-race from Pisa to the altar of Poseidon on the Isthmos of Korinthos, and the starting of the horses he arranged as follows : Oinomaos was to be sacrificing a ram to Zeus, when the suitor should set out, driving a chariot drawn by four horses; then, when the sacrifice had been completed, Oinomaos was to begin the race and make after the suitor, having a spear and Myrtilos (Myrtilus) as his driver, and if he should succeed in overtaking the chariot which he was pursuing he was to smite the suitor with the spear and slay him. By employing this method he kept overtaking the suitors as they appeared, his horses being swift, and was slaying them in great numbers.
     <br/>
     But when Pelops, the son of Tantalos, came to Pisa and looked upon Hippodameia, he set his heart upon marrying her, and by corrupting Myrtilos, the charioteer of Oinomaos, and thus securing his co-operation toward winning the victory, he was the first to arrive at the altar of Poseidon on the Isthmos. And Oinomaos, believing that the oracle had been fulfilled, was so disheartened by grief that he removed himself from life. In this way, then, Pelops got Hippodameia for his wife and succeeded to the sovereignty of Pisa, and increasing steadily in power by reason of his courage and his wisdom, he won over to himself the larger number of those who dwelt in the Peloponnesos and called the land after his own name the island of Pelops ‘Peloponnesos.’"

Myrtilos (Myrtilus) too, the charioteer of Oinomaos, sits in front of the horses, which are four in number. After him are two men. They have no names, but they too must be under orders from Oinomaos to attend to the horses.

     "The race-course [at Olympia] has one side longer than the other, and on the longer side, which is a bank, there stands, at the passage through the bank, Taraxippos (Taraxippus), the terror of the horses. It has the shape of a round altar, and as they run along the horses are seized, as soon as they reach this point, by a great fear without any apparent reason. The fear leads to disorder; the chariots generally crash and the charioteers are injured. Consequently the charioteers offer sacrifice, and pray that Taraxippos may show himself propitious to them.
     <br/>
     The Greeks differ in their view of Taraxippos . . . There is also a story that Pelops made here an empty mound in honor of Myrtilos (Myrtilus), and sacrificed to him in an effort to calm the anger of the murdered man, naming the mound Taraxippos (Frightener of horses) because the mares of Oinomaos (Oenomaus) were frightened by the trick of Myrtilos. Some say that it is Oinomaos himself who harms the racers in the course. I have also heard some attach the blame to Alkathos (Alcathus), the son of Porthaon. Killed by Oinomaos because he wooed Hippodameia, Alkathos, they say, here got his portion of earth; having been unsuccessful on the course, he is a spiteful and hostile deity to chariot-drivers.
     <br/>
     A man of Egypt said that Pelops received something from Amphion the Theban [i.e. the brother-in-law of Pelops] and buried it where is what they call Taraxippos, adding that it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of Oinomaos, as well as those of every charioteer since.

     <br/>
     Going on from this point you come to the water of Parthenia, and by the river is the grave of the mares of Marmax. The story has it that this Marmax was the first suitor of Hippodameia to arrive, and that he was killed by Oinomaos before the others; that the names of his mares were Parthenia and Eripha; that Oinomaos slew the mares after Marmax, but granted burial to them also, and that the river received the name Parthenia from the mare of Marmax.
     <br/>
     There is another river called Harpinates, and not far from the river are, among the other ruins of a city Harpina, its altars. The city was founded, they say, by Oinomaos, who named it after his mother Harpina.
     <br/>
     A little farther on is a high mound of earth, the grave of the suitors of Hippodameia. Now Oinomaos, they say, laid them in the ground near one another with no token of respect. But afterwards Pelops raised a high monument to them all, to honor them and to please Hippodamaeia. I think too that Pelops wanted a memorial to tell posterity the number and character of the men vanquished by Oinomaos before Pelops himself conquered him.
     <br/>
     According to the epic poem called the
     <em>
      Great Eoiai
     </em>
     the next after Marmax to be killed by Oinomaos was Alkathos (Alcathus), son of Porthaon; after Alkathos came Euryalos, Eurymakhos (Eurymachus) and Krotalos (Crotalus). Now the parents and fatherlands of these I was unable to discover, but Akrias (Acrias), the next after them to be killed, one might guess to have been a Lakedaimonian and the founder of Akriai (Acriae). After Akrias they say that Oinomaos slew Kapetos (Capetus), Lykourgos (Lycurgus), Lasios, Khalkodon (Chalcodon) and Trikolonos (Tricolonus), who, according to the Arkadians, was the descendant and namesake of Trikolonos, the son of Lykaon (Lycaon). After Trikolonos there met their fate in the race Aristomakhos (Aristomachus) and Prias, and then Pelagon, Aiolios (Aeolius) and Kronios (Cronius). Some add to the aforesaid Erythras, the son of Leukon, the son of Athamas, after whom was named Erythrai (Erythrae) in Boiotia, and Eioneus, the son of Magnes the son of Aiolos (Aeolus). These are the men whose monument is here, and Pelops, they say, sacrificed every year to them as heroes, when he had won the sovereignty of Pisa.
     <br/>
     Going forward about a stade from the grave one sees traces of a sanctuary of Artemis, surnamed Kordax (Cordax) because the followers of Pelops celebrated their victory by the side of this goddess and danced the
     <em>
      kordax
     </em>
     , a dance peculiar to the dwellers round Mount Sipylos (Sipylus) [in Lydia]. Not far from the sanctuary is a small building containing a bronze chest, in which are kept the bones of Pelops.

Whenever a man arrived to woo the daughter of Oinomaos, Myrtilos craftily drove on the mares, while Oinomaos on the course shot down the wooer when he came near.
     <br/>
     Myrtilos himself, too, was in love with Hippodameia, but his courage failing him he shrank from the competition and served Oinomaos as his charioteer. At last, it is said, he proved a traitor to Oinomaos, being induced thereto by an oath sworn by Pelops that he would let him be with Hippodameia for one night. So when reminded of his oath Pelops threw him out of the ship. The people of Pheneus say that the body of Myrtilos was cast ashore by the tide, that they took it up and buried it, and that every year they sacrifice to him by night as to a hero.

     It is plain that Pelops did not make a long coasting voyage, but only sailed from the mouth of the Alpheios (ALpheus) to the harbor of Elis.

The chariot lies shattered through a trick of Myrtilos (Myrtilus). It is a four-horse chariot; for though men were not yet bold enough to use the quadriga in war, yet in the games it was known and prized, and the Lydians also, a people most devoted to horses, drove four abreast in the time of Pelops and already used chariots, and at a later time devised the chariot with four poles and, it is said, were the first to drive eight horses abreast.
     <br/>
     Look, my boy, at the horses of Oinomaos, how fierce they are and keen to run, full of rage and covered with foam--you will find such horses especially among the Arkadians-- and how black they are, harnessed as they were for a monstrous and accursed deed. But look at the horse of Pelops, how white they are, obedient to the rein, comrades as they are of Peitho (Persuasion), neighing gently and as if aware of the coming victory. And look at Oinomaos, how like he is to Diomedes he Thrakian as he lies there, a barbarian and savage of aspect. But as to Pelops, on the other hand, you will not, I think, be inclined to doubt that Poseidon once on a time fell in love with him for his beauty when he was wine-pourer for the gods on Mount Sipylos (Sipylus), and because of his love set him, though still a youth, upon this chariot. The chariot runs over the sea as easily as on land, and not even a drop of water ever splashes on its axle, but the sea, firm as the earth itself, supports the horses.
     <br/>
     As for the race, Pelops and Hippodameia are the victors, both standing on the chariot and there joining hands; but they are so conquered by each other that they are on the point of embracing one another. He is dressed in the delicate Lydian manner, and is of such youth and beauty as you noticed a moment ago when he was begging Poseidon for his horses; and she is dressed in a wedding garment and has just unveiled her cheek, now that she has won the right to a husband's embrace. Even the [the river-god] Alpheios (Alpheus) leaps from his eddy to pluck a crown of wild olive for Pelops as he drives along the bank of the river.
     <br/>
     The mounds along the race-course mark the graves of the suitors by whose death Oinomaos postponed his daughter's marriage, thirteen youths in all. But the earth (
     <em>
      gê

     ) now causes flowers to spring up on their graves, that they too may share the semblance of being crowned on the occasion of Oinomaos' punishment."

     "[Ostensibly a description of an ancient Greek painting in Neapolis (Naples) :] A delicate garment of Lydian fashion, a lad with beard just beginning to grow, Poseidon smiling at him and honouring the lad with a gift of horses--all this shows that it is Pelops the Lydian who has come to the sea in order to invoke Poseidon's aid against Oinomaos (Oenomaus); since Oinomaos accepts no son-in-law, but slaying the suitors of Hippodameia he takes pride in their severed members as hunters who have captures game take pride in the heads of bears or lions. And in answer to Pelops' prayer a golden chariot has come out of the sea, but the horses are of mainland breed, and able to speed over the Aegean with dry axle and light hoof. The task will go off well for Pelops, but let us examine the task of the painter.
     <br/>
     It requires no small effort, in my opinion to compose four horses together and not to confuse their several legs one with another, to impart to them high spirits controlled by the bridle, and to hold them still, one at the very moment when he does not want to stand still, another when he wants to paw the ground, a third when he [wants to lift up his head], while the fourth takes delight in the beauty of Pelops and his nostrils are distended as though he were neighing. This too is a clever touch : Poseidon loves the lad and brings him to the cauldron and to Klotho, after which Pelops' shoulder seemed to shine; and he did not try to divert him from the marriage, since the lad is eager for it, but being content even to touch his hand, he clasps the right hand of Pelops while he counsels him about the race; and already Pelops proudly ‘breathes Alpheios,’ and his look follows the steeds. Charming is his glance and elated because he is proud of the diadem, from which the hair of the lad trickling down like golden sprays of water follows the lines of his forehead, and joins the bright down on his cheeks, and though it falls this way and that, yet it lies gracefully. The hip and breast, and the other parts of the naked body of Pelops which might be mentioned, the painting conceals; a garment covers his arms and even his lower legs. For the Lydians and the upper barbarians, encasing their beauty in such garments, pride themselves on these weavings, when they might pride themselves on their natural form. While the rest of his figure is out of sight and covered, the garment by his left shoulder is artfully neglected in order that its gleam may not be hidden; for the night draws on, and the lad glows with the radiance of his shoulder as does the night with that of the evening star."

     "Oenomaus, son of Mars [Ares] and Asterope, daughter of Atlas, had as wife Evarete, daughter of Acrisius. By her he became father of Hippodamia, a maiden of exceptional beauty, but he did not give her in marriage to anyone because an oracle had told him to beware of death from his son-in-law. And so when many sought her in marriage, he set a contest; and, since he had horses swifter than the wind, he said the would give her to the one who competed with him in a four-horse chariot race and came out ahead, but that the loser should be put to death. Many were put to death. Finally Pelops, son of Tantalus, came, but when he saw fixed above the door the heads of those who had sought Hippodamia as wife, out of fear of the cruelty of the king he regretted having come. And so he won the confidence of his charioteer, Myrtilus, and promised him the half of the kingdom for his help. Myrtilus pledged his word, and when he yoked the horses did not put the pin in the wheels. So the horses when driven at full speed tore to pieces the weakened chariot of Oenomaus. Pelops, coming home as victor with Hippodamia and Myrtilus, though the affair would disgrace him and refused to keep his promise to Myrtilus but cast him into the sea, which is called Myrtoan from this. He took Hippodamia to his country which is called Peloponnesus; there by Hippodamia he became father of Hippalcus, Atreus, and Thyestes."

To the right of the entrance of the temple of Zeus, on the north side, lies the Pelopion (Pelopium, Temple of Pelops). It is far enough removed from the temple for statues and other offerings to stand in the intervening space, and beginning at about the middle of the temple it extends as far as the rear chamber. It is surrounded by a stone fence, within which trees grow and statues have been dedicated.

     The entrance is on the west. The sanctuary is said to have been set apart to Pelops by Herakles the son of Amphitryon. Herakles too was a great-grandson of Pelops, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him into the pit. Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacrifice to him, and the victim is a black ram.

The Games consist of foot-races for maidens. These are not all of the same age. The first to run are the youngest; after them come the next in age, and the last to run are the oldest of the maidens. They run in the following way : their hair hangs down, a tunic reaches to a little above the knee, and they bare the right shoulder as far as the breast. These too have the Olympic stadium reserved for their games, but the course of the stadium is shortened for them by about one-sixth of its length. To the winning maidens they give crowns of olive and a portion of the cow sacrificed to Hera. They may also dedicate statues with their names inscribed upon them. Those who administer to the Sixteen are, like the presidents of the games, married women.
     <br/>
     The games of the maidens too are traced back to ancient times; they say that, out of gratitude to Hera for her marriage with Pelops, Hippodameia assembled the Sixteen Women, and with them inaugurated the Heraia. They relate too that a victory was won by Khloris (Chloris), the only surviving daughter of the house of Amphion, though with her they say survived one of her brothers."

     "Of the gods, the people of Khaironeia (Chaeronia) [a village near Delphoi in Phokis (Phocis)] honor most the scepter which Homer says Hephaistos (Hephaestus) made for Zeus, Hermes received from Zeus and gave to Pelops, Pelops left to Atreus, Atreus to Thyestes, and Agamemnon had from Thyestes. This scepter, then, they worship, calling it Spear. That there is something peculiarly divine about this scepter is most clearly shown by the fame it brings to the Khaironeans. They say that it was discovered on the border of their own country and of Panopeus in Phokis, that with it the Phokians discovered gold, and that they were glad themselves to get the scepter instead of the gold. I am of opinion that it was brought to Phokis by Agamemnon's daughter Elektra (Electra). It has no public temple made for it, but its priest keeps the scepter for one year in a house. Sacrifices are offered to it every day, and by its side stands a table full of meats and cakes of all sorts."

He gave many daughters in marriage to men of highest rank, and scattered many sons among the cities as their rulers. One of these, named Pittheus, the grandfather of Theseus, founded the little city of Troizenos (Troezen)."

     THE CURSE OF THE PELOPIDAE
    </h3>
    <p>
     The house of Pelops was inflicted with a family curse which was passed down through the generations from father to son--from Pelops to his sons Atreus and Thyestes, from them to their sons Agamemnon and Aigisthos (Aegisthus), and finally to Orestes. The original curse borne by Pelops had a cascading effect with each subsequent generation being driven to commit further crimes, so bringing more curses down upon the family.

Here hang their votive gifts; resounding trumpets and broken chariots, spoils of the Myrtoan Sea [i.e. of Myrtilus who was murdered by Pelops], and wheels o'ercome by treacherous axle-trees hang there, and memorials of the race's every crime; in this place is Pelops' Phrygian turban hung, here spoil of the enemy, and the embroidered robe, token of triumph o'er barbaric foes."

When the war of the Greeks against Troy was prolonged, the soothsayers prophesied to them that they would not take the city until they had fetched the bow and arrows of Herakles and a bone of Pelops. So it is said that they sent for Philoktetes (Philoctetes) to the camp, and from Pisa was brought to them a bone of Pelops--a shoulder-blade. As they were returning home, the ship carrying the bone of Pelops was wrecked off Euboia (Euboea) in the storm.
     <br/>
     Many years later than the capture of Troy, Damarmenos, a fisherman from Eretria, cast a net into the sea and drew up the bone. Marvelling at its size he kept it hidden in the sand. At last he went to Delphoi (Delphi), to inquire whose the bone was, and what he ought to do with it.
     <br/>
     It happened that by the providence of Heaven there was then at Delphoi an Eleian embassy praying for deliverance from a pestilence. So the Pythian priestess ordered the Eleians to recover the bones of Pelops, and Damarmenos to give back to the Eleians what he had found. He did so, and the Eleians repaid him by appointing him and his descendants to be guardians of the bone. The shoulder-blade of Pelops had disappeared by my time, because, I suppose, it had been hidden in the depths so long, and besides its age it was greatly decayed through the salt water."

     1. Pisa (southern Elis); 2. Elis (central Elis); 3. Bouprasion (northern Elis); 4. Doulikhion (island west of Elis); 5. Olenos (northern Elis &amp; western Akhaia).
     <br/>
     NOTES
     <br/>
     * Eleios-Heleios is the same figure. One tradition represents him as a son of Perseus and the heir of King Pelops, another makes him a grandson of King Endymion. He was sometimes confounded with the sun-god Helios.
     <br/>
     ** Augeias ruled the whole of Elis including the regions of Elis, Pisa, Bouprasion and Doulikhion. After his death the kingdom was divided into four autonomous parts.
     <br/>
     *** Amarynkeus received a quarter of the kingdom of Augeias. One assumes his portion was Pisatis.
     <br/>
     **** In the reign of Hipponoos, Olenos was annexed by King Oineus of Aitolia. It is listed as an Aitolian dominion in Homer's
     <em>
      Catalogue of Ships
     </em>
