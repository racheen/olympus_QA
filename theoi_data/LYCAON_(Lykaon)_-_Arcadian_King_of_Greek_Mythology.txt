   LYCAON (Lykaon) - Arcadian King of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Lycaon was an early king of Arcadia who lived in the time before the Great Deluge. He sought to test the divinity of Zeus by serving the god a slaughtered child--either his son Nyctimus, his grandson Arcas, or a Molossian captive. Zeus was furious and overturning the table, destroyed the fifty sons of Lycaon with lightning-bolts, and transformed the king into a wolf." name="description"/>

     LYKAON (Lycaon) was an early king of Arkadia who lived in the time before the
     <a href="Deukalion.html">
      Great Deluge
     </a>
     . He sought to test the divinity of
     <a href="../Olympios/Zeus.html">
      Zeus
     </a>
     by serving the god a slaughtered child--either his son Nyktimos (Nyctimus), his grandson Arkas (Arcas), or a Molossian captive. Zeus was furious and  overturning the table, destroyed the fifty sons of Lykaon with lightning-bolts, and transformed the king into a wolf.
    </p>
    <h3>
     CHRONOLOGY OF MYTH
    </h3>
    <p>
     In the chronology of myth Lykaon was a contemporary of
     <a href="Deukalion.html">
      Deukalion (Deucalion)
     </a>
     , king of Thessalia, and
     <a href="Kekrops.html">
      Kekrops (Cecrops)
     </a>
     , king of Athens. His fifty sons founded and gave their names to the towns and villages of Arkadia. Lykaon was succeeded on the throne by his youngest son Nyktimos or grandson Arkas. Some say that Nyktimos was preserved by
     <a href="../Protogenos/Gaia.html">
      Gaia
     </a>
     (the Earth) when his brothers were struck down by  the lightning-bolts of Zeus, others that he was the child sacrificed by Lykaon who was afterwards resurrected by the gods   (cf. the story of the sacrifice and resurrection of
     <a href="Pelops.html">
      Pelops
     </a>

    <p>
     LYCAON (Lykaôn), a son of Pelasgus by Meliboea, the daughter of Oceanus, and king of Arcadia (Apollod. iii. 8. § 1). Others call him a son of Pelasgus by Cyllene (Schol.
     <em>
      ad Eurip. Orest.
     </em>
     1642), and Dionysius of Halicarnassus (i. 11, 13) distinguishes between an elder and a younger Lycaon, the former of whom is called a son of Aezeus and father of Deianeira, by whom Pelasgus became the father of the younger Lycaon. The traditions about him place Lycaon in very different lights, for according to some, he was a barbarian who even defied the gods (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 198, &amp;c.), while others describe him as the first civiliser of Arcadia, who built the town of Lycosura, and introduced the worship of Zeus Lycaeus. It is added that he sacrificed a child on the altar of Zeus, and that during the sacrifice he was changed by Zeus into a wolf (Paus. viii. 2. § 1; comp. Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     i. 237). By several wives Lycaon became the father of a large number of sons, some say fifty, and others only twenty-two; but neither their number nor their names are the same in all accounts (Apollod., Dionys.
     <em>
      ll. cc.;
     </em>
     Paus. viii. 3. § 1; Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 313). The sons of Lycaon are said to have been notorious for their insolence and impiety, and Zeus visited them in the disguise of a poor man, with a view to punish them. They invited him to a repast, and on the suggestion of one of them, Maenalus, they mixed in one of the dishes set before him the entrails of a boy whom they had murdered. According to Ovid Zeus was recognised and worshipped by the Arcadian people, but Lycaon, after a vain attempt to kill the god, resolved to try him with the dish of human flesh (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph.
     </em>
     481; Eratosth.
     <em>
      Catest.
     </em>
     8). However, Zeus pushed away the table which bore the horrible food, and the place where this happened was afterwards called Trapezus. Lycaon and all his sons, with the exception of the youngest (or eldest), Nyctimus, were killed by Zeus with a flash of lightning, or according to others, were changed into wolves (Ov., Tzetz.
     <em>
      ll. cc.;
     </em>
     Paus. viii. 3. § 1). Some say that the flood of Deucalion occurred in the reign of Nyctimus, as a punishment of the crimes of the Lycaonids. (Apollod.
     <em>
      l. c.

     )

He had a son Lykaon (Lycaon) by Meliboia (Meliboea), daughter of Okeanos (Oceanus) or, as others say, by a nymphe Kyllene (Cyllene); and Lykaon, reigning over the Arkadians (Arcadians), begat by many wives fifty sons, to wit : Melaineus, Thesprotos, Helix, Nyktimos, Peuketios, Kaukon, Mekisteus, Hopleus, Makareus, Makednos, Horos, Polikhos, Akontes, Euaimon, Ankyor, Arkhebates, Karteron, Aigaion, Pallas, Eumon, Kanethos, Prothoos, Linos, Korethon, Mainalos, Teleboes, Physios, Phassos, Phthios, Lykios, Halipheros, Genetor, Boukolion, Sokleus, Phineus, Eumetes, Harpaleus, Portheus, Platon, Haimon, Kynaithos, Leon, Harpalykos, Heraieus, Titanas, Mantineus, Kleitor, Stymphalos, Orkhomenos, ((lacuna)) . .

     These exceeded all men in pride and impiety; and Zeus, desirous of putting their impiety to the proof, came to them in the likeness of a day-laborer. They offered him hospitality and having slaughtered a male child of the natives, they mixed his bowels with the sacrifices, and set them before him, at the instigation of the elder brother Mainalos. But Zeus in disgust upset the table at the place which is still called Trapezos, and blasted Lykaon and his sons by thunderbolts, all but Nyktimos (Nyctimus), the youngest; for Ge (Gaea, the Earth) was quick enough to lay hold of the right hand of Zeus and so appease his wrath. But when Nyktimos succeeded to the kingdom, there occurred the flood in the age of Deukalion (Deucalion); some said that it was occasioned by the impiety of Lykaon's sons.

     "Lykaon (Lycaon) the son of Pelasgos (Pelasgus) devised the following plans, which were more clever than those of his father. He founded the city Lykosoura (Lycosura) on Mount Lykaios (Lycaeus), gave to Zeus the surname Lykaios and founded the Lykaian (Lycaean) games. I hold that the Panathenian festival was not founded before the Lykaian. The early name for the former festival was the Athenian, which was changed to the Panathenian in the time of Theseus, because it was then established by the whole Athenian people gathered together in a single city . . .
     <br/>
     My view is that Lykaon was contemporary with Kekrops (Cecrops), the king of Athens, but that they were not equally wise in matters of religion. For Kekrops was the first to name Zeus Hypatos (the Supreme god), and refused to sacrifice anything that had life in it, but burnt instead on the altar the national cakes which the Athenians still call
     <em>
      pelanoi
     </em>
     . But Lykaon brought a human baby to the altar of Zeus Lykaios, and sacrificed it, pouring out its blood upon the altar, and according to the legend immediately after the sacrifice he was changed from a man to a wolf (
     <em>
      lykos
     </em>
     ).
     <br/>
     I for my part believe this story; it has been a legend among the Arkadians from of old, and it has the additional merit of probability. For the men of those days, because of their righteousness and piety, were guests of the gods, eating at the same board; the good were openly honored by the gods, and sinners were openly visited with their wrath . . .  So one might believe that Lykaon was turned into a beast . . .
     <br/>
     All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and even some that occur to-day, have been generally discredited because of the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance, that ever since the time of Lykaon a man has changed into a wolf at the sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios, but that the change is not for life; if, when he is a wolf, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes a man again, but if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever . . . Those who like to listen to the miraculous are themselves apt to add to the marvel, and so they ruin truth by mixing it with falsehood."

     "When, from his throne supreme, the Son [Zeus] of Saturn [Kronos] viewed their [mankind's] deeds, he deeply groaned : and calling to his mind the loathsome feast Lycaon had prepared, a recent deed not common to report, his soul conceived great anger--worthy Jove [Zeus]--and he convened a council . . . [and] indignantly  began to speak : ‘. . . Now must I utterly destroy this mortal race wherever Nereus [i.e. the sea] roars around the world . . . [for] I, your sovereign lord, the Thunder-bolt Controller, am ensnared by fierce Lycaon.’
     <br/>
     Ardent in their wrath, the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake this miscreant; he who dared commit such crimes . . . and as indignant clamour ceased, suppressed by regnant majesty, Jove once again broke the deep silence with imperial words : ‘Dismiss your cares; he paid the penalty however all the crime and punishment now learn from this :--An infamous report of this unholy age had reached my ears, and wishing it were false, I sloped my course from high Olympus, and--although a god--disguised in human form I viewed the world. It would delay us to recount the crimes unnumbered, for reports were less than truth. I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens abound, over Lycaeus, wintry slopes of pine tree groves, across Cyllene steep; and as the twilight warned of night's approach, I stopped in that Arcadian tyrant's realms and entered his inhospitable home :--and when I showed his people that a god had come, the lowly prayed and worshiped me, but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows and scoffing said; "A fair experiment will prove the truth if this be god or man." and he prepared to slay me in the night,--to end my slumbers in the sleep of death. So made he merry with his impious proof; but not content with this he cut the throat of a Molossian hostage sent to him, and partly softened his still quivering limbs in boiling water, partly roasted them on fires that burned beneath. And when this flesh was served to me on tables, I destroyed his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods, with thunder bolts avenging. Terror struck he took to flight, and on the silent plains is howling in his vain attempts to speak; he raves and rages and his greedy jaws, desiring their accustomed slaughter, turn against the sheep--still eager for their blood. His vesture separates in shaggy hair, his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf he has the same grey locks, the same hard face, the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look. Thus fell one house, but not one house alone deserved to perish; over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail,--all men conspire in evil. Let them therefore feel the weight of dreadful penalties so justly earned, for such hath my unchanging will ordained.’"

Those present at the sacrifice wanted to know whether they really were going to having a god as their guest; and, since Lykaon had fifty sons, as they say, from many wives, they sacrificed one of his children and mixed him in with the meat of the sacrifice, so that they would not fail to learn whether a god was really coming. Then great storms and lightning strikes were sent by the divine, and they say all the child's murderers perished."

     LEGEND OF  THE LYCANTHROPE (WEREWOLF)
    </h3>
    <p>
     The word lycanthrope--Greek
     <em>
      lykanthropos
     </em>
     , meaning "wolf-man" or "werewolf"--has its origins in the cult of Zeus on Mount Lykaion (Lycaeum) in Arkadia. It was here, according to Greek myth, that King Lykaon sacrificed, or served a meal of, a child to the god and was  transformed into a wolf. Local legend went on to recount that an initiate into the secret rites of the Zeus Lykaios would undergo a similar metamorphosis, being transformed into wolf for a period of nine years. If he abstained from human flesh during this period, he would then regain his human form.

     <em>

     ) . . .
     <br/>
     All through the ages, many events that have occurred in the past, and even some that occur to-day, have been generally discredited because of the lies built up on a foundation of fact. It is said, for instance, that ever since the time of Lykaon a man has changed into a wolf at the sacrifice to Zeus Lykaios, but that the change is not for life; if, when he is a wolf, he abstains from human flesh, after nine years he becomes a man again, but if he tastes human flesh he remains a beast for ever."

     "Among the marvels of Mount Lykaios (Lycaeus) the most wonderful is this. On it is a precinct of Zeus Lykaios, into which people are not allowed to enter. If anyone takes no notice of the rule and enters, he must inevitably live no longer than a year. A legend, moreover, was current that everything alike within the precinct, whether beast or man, cast no shadow. For this reason when a beast takes refuge in the precinct, the hunter will not rush in after it, but remains outside, and though he sees the beast can behold no shadow . . . 
  On the highest point of the mountain [Lykaios] is a mound of earth, forming an altar of Zeus Lykaios, and from it most of the Peloponnesos can be seen. Before the altar on the east stand two pillars, on which there were of old gilded eagles. On this altar they sacrifice in secret to Zeus Lykaios. I was reluctant to pry into the details of the sacrifice; let them be as they are and were from the beginning."

     "In the third generation after Pelasgos (Pelasgus) the land [of Arkadia (Arcadia)] increased in the number both of its cities and of its population. For Nyktimos (Nyctimus), who was the eldest son of Lykaon (Lycaon), possessed all the power, while the other sons founded cities on the sites they considered best. Thus Pallantion (Pallantium) was founded by Pallas, Oresthasion by Orestheus and Phigalia by Phigalos.
     <br/>
     Pallantion is mentioned by Stesikhoros (Stesichorus) of Himera in his
     <em>
      Geryoneis
     </em>
     . Phigalia and Oresthasion in course of time changed their names, Oresthasion to Oresteion after Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, Phigalia to Phialia after Phialos, the son of Boukolion (Bucolion). Cities were founded by Trapezeus also, and by Daseatas, Makareus (Macareus), Helisson, Akakos (Acacus) and Thoknos (Thocnus). The last founded Thoknia (Thocnia), and Akakos Akakesion (Acacesium). It was after this Akakos, according to the Arkadian account, that Homer made a surname for Hermes.
     <br/>
     Helisson has given a name to both the town and the river so called, and similarly Makaria (Macaria), Dasea, and Trapezoeis were named after the sons of Lykaon.
     <br/>
     Orkhomenos (Orchomenus) became founder of both the town called Methydrion and of Orkhomenos, styled by Homer ‘rich in sheep.’ Hypsos and [Melaineus, Thyraios and Haimon] ((lacuna)) , ,  founded Melaineai and Hypsos, and Thyraion (Thyraeum) and Haimoniai (Haemoniae).
     <br/>
     The Arkadians are of opinion that both the Thyrea in Argolis and also the Thyrean gulf were named after this Thyraios (Thyraeus).
     <br/>
     Mainalos (Maenalus) founded Mainalos, which was in ancient times the most famous of the cities of Arkadia, Tegeates founded Tegea and Mantineus Mantineia.
     <br/>
     Kromoi (Cromi) was named after Kromos (Cromus), Kharisia (Charisia) after Kharisios (Charisius), its founder, Trikolonoi (Tricoloni) after Trikolonos, Peraithenses after Peraithos, Asea after Aseates, Lykoa (Lycoa) after [Lykon] ((lacuna)) . . and Soumatia (Sumatea) after Soumateus. Alipheros also and Heraieus both gave their names to cities.
     <br/>
     But Oinotros (Oenotrus), the youngest of the sons of Lykaon, asked his brother Nyktimos for money and men and crossed by sea to Italia; the land of Oinotria (Oenotria) received its name from Oinotros who was its king. This was the first expedition despatched from Greece to found a colony, and if a man makes the most careful calculation possible he will discover that no foreigners either emigrated to another land before Oinotros.
     <br/>
     In addition to all this male issue, Lykaon had a daughter Kallisto (Callisto). This Kallisto (I repeat the current Greek legend) was loved by Zeus and mated with him."
