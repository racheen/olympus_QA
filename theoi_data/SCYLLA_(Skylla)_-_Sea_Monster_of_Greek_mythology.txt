   SCYLLA (Skylla) - Sea Monster of Greek mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Scylla was a sea-monster who haunted the rocks of a narrow strait opposite the whirlpool of Charybdis. Ships who sailed too close to her rocks would lose six men to her ravenous, darting heads. Homer describes Scylla as a creature with twelve dangling feet, six long necks and grisly heads lined with a triple row of sharp teeth." name="description"/>

     SKYLLA (Scylla) was a sea-monster who haunted the rocks of a narrow strait opposite the whirlpool of
     <a href="Kharybdis.html">
      Kharybdis (Charybdis)
     </a>
     . Ships who sailed too close to her rocks would lose six men to her ravenous, darting heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Homer describes Skylla as a creature with twelve dangling feet, six long necks and grisly heads lined with a triple row of sharp teeth. Her voice was likened to the yelping of dogs. This description of Skylla is probably derived from the  imagery of words associated with her name--namely, "hermit-crab" (Greek
     <em>
      skyllaros
     </em>
     ), "dog" and "dog-shark" (
     <em>
      skylax
     </em>
     ), and "to rend" (
     <em>
      skyllô
     </em>
     ). In classical art she was depicted as a fish-tailed sea-goddess with a cluster of canine fore-parts surrounding her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     According to late classical writers she was once a beautiful nymph  loved by the sea-god
     <a href="Glaukos.html">
      Glaukos (Glaucus)
     </a>
     , but her jealous rival, the  witch
     <a href="../Titan/Kirke.html">
      Kirke (Circe)
     </a>
     , employed magic to transform her into a monster. Older poets, however, envisaged Skylla as simply a monster born into a monstrous family.

     SCYLLA (Skulla) and Charybdis, the names of two rocks between Italy and Sicily, and only a short distance from one another. In the midst of the one of these rocks which was nearest to Italy, there dwelt, according to Homer, Scylla, a daughter of Crataeis, a fearful monster, barking like a dog, with twelve feet, six long necks and mouths, each of which contained three rows of sharp teeth. The opposite rock, which was much lower, contained an immense fig-tree, under which there dwelt Charybdis, who thrice every day swallowed down the waters of the sea, and thrice threw them up again : both were formidable to the ships which had to pass between them (Hom.
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     xii. 73, &amp;c., 235, &amp;c.). Later traditions represent Scylla as a daughter of Phorcys or Phorbas, by Hecate Crataeis (Apollon. Rhod. iv. 828, &amp;c., with the Scholiast), or by Lamia; while others make her a daughter of Triton, or Poseidon and Crataeis (Eustath.
     <em>
      ad Hom.
     </em>
     p. 1714), or of Typhon and Echidna (Hygin.
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     praef.). Some, again, describe her as a monster with six heads of different animals, or with only three heads (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph. 650 ;
     </em>
     Eustath.
     <em>
      l. c.
     </em>
     ). One tradition relates that Scylla originally was a beautiful maiden, who often played with the nymphs of the sea, and was beloved by the marine god Glaucus. He applied to Circe for means to make Scylla return his love; but Circe, jealous of the fair maiden, threw magic herbs into the well in which Scylla was wont to bathe, and by these herbs the maiden was metamorphosed in such a manner, that the upper part of her body remained that of a woman, while the lower part was changed into the tail of a fish or serpent, surrounded by dogs (Ov.
     <em>
      Met.
     </em>
     xiii. 732, &amp;c., 905, xiv. 40, &amp;c.; Tibull. iii. 4. 89). Another tradition related that Scylla was beloved by Poseidon, and that Amphitrite, from jealousy, metamorphosed her into a monster (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph. 45 ;
     </em>
     Serv.
     <em>
      ad Aen.
     </em>
     iii. 420). Heracles is said to have killed her, because she had stolen some of the oxen of Geryon; but Phorcys is said to have restored her to life (Eustath., Tzetz., Hygin.,
     <em>
      l. c.
     </em>
     ). Virgil (
     <em>
      Aen.
     </em>
     vi. 286) speaks of several Scyllae, and places them in the lower world (comp. Lucret. v. 893).

      Homer, Odyssey 12. 54 ff (trans. Shewring) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[Kirke (Circe) warns Odysseus of the dangers he will face on his journey :] ‘When your crew have rowed past the Seirenes (Sirens), I will not expressly say to you which of two ways you ought to take; you must follow your own counsel there; I will only give you knowledge of both. On the one side are overshadowing rocks against which dash the mighty billows of the goddess of blue-glancing seas. The blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers . . . On the other side are a pair of cliffs. One of them with its jagged peak reaches up to the spreading sky, wreathed in dark cloud that never parts. There is no clear sky above this peak even in summer or harvest-time, nor could any mortal man climb up it or get a foothold on it, not if he had twenty hands and feet; so smooth is the stone, as if it were all burnished over. Half-way up the cliff is a murky cave, facing Erebos, and doubtless it is past this, Odysseus, that you and your men will steer your vessel. A strong man's arrow shot from a ship below would not reach the recesses of that cave. Inside lives Skylla (Scylla), yelping hideously; her voice is no deeper than a young puppy's but she herself is a fearsome monster; no one could see her and still be happy, not even a god if he went that way. She has twelve feet all dangling down, six long necks with a grisly head on each of them, and in each head a triple row of crowded and close-set teeth, fraught with black death. Sunk waist-deep in the cave's recesses, she still darts out her head from that frightening hollow, and there, groping greedily round the rock, she fishes for dolphins (
     <em>
      delphines
     </em>
     ) and for sharks (
     <em>
      kynes
     </em>
     ) and whatever beast (
     <em>
      ketos
     </em>
     ) more huge than these she can seize upon from all the thousands that have their pasture from  loud-moaning Amphitrite. No seaman ever, in any vessel, has boasted of sailing that way unharmed, for with every single head of hers she snatches and carries off a man from the dark-prowed ship. You will see that the other cliff lies lower, no more than an arrow's flight away. On this there grows a great leafy fig-tree; under it, awesome Kharybdis (Charybdis) sucks the dark water down . . . No, keep closer to Skylla's cliff, and row past that as quickly as may be; far better to lose six men and keep your ship than to lose your men one and all.’
     <br/>
     So she spoke, and I answered her: ‘Yes, goddess, but tell me truly--could I somehow escape this dire Kharybdis and yet make a stand against the other when she sought to make my men her prey?’
     <br/>
     So I spoke, and at once the queenly goddess answered : ‘Self-willed man , is your mind then set on further perils, fresh feats of war? Will you not bow to the deathless gods themselves? Skylla is not of mortal kind; she is a deathless monster, grim and baleful, savage, not to be wrestled with. Against her there is no defence, and the best path is the path of flight. If you pause to arm beside that rock, I fear that she may dart out again, seize again with as many heads and snatch as many men as before. No, row hard and invoke Krataiis (Crataeis); she is Skylla's mother; it is she who bore her to plague mankind; Krataiis will hold her from darting twice.’"

      Homer, Odyssey 12. 210 - 259 :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "But the island [of the Seirenes (Sirens)] was hardly left behind when I [Odysseus] saw smoke above heavy breakers and heard a great noise . . .
     <br/>
     [Odysseus addresses his crew :] ‘. . . And to you, steersman . . . keep the craft away from the smoke and breakers and rather make for the rock yonder, lest unawares you should let the ship drive the other way and should bring us all to ruin.’
     <br/>
     So I spoke, and at once they obeyed my words. I had stopped short of mentioning Skylla (Scylla), an inexorable horror; the crew in fear might have left their oars and huddled down inside the hold. And here I let myself forget that irksome command of Kirke's (Circe's); she had told me not to arm at all, but I put my glorious armour on, took a long spear in either hand and strode up to the half-deck forward, since it was from there that I thought to catch the first glimpse of Skylla, that monster of the rock who was bringing doom to my companions. I could not as yet spy her anywhere, and my eyes grew tired as I peered this way and that toward the misty rock.
     <br/>
     So with much lamenting we rowed on and into the strait; this side lay Skylla; that side in hideous fashion, fiendish Kharybdis (Charybdis) . . . 
  We had looked her way with the fear of death upon us; and at that moment Skylla snatched up from inside my ship the six of my crew who were strongest of arm and sturdiest. When I turned back my gaze to the ship in search of my companions, I saw only their feet and hands as they were lifted up; they were calling to me in their heart's anguish, crying out my name for the last time. As when a fisherman on a promontory takes a long rod to snare little fishes with his bait and casts his ox-hair line down in to the sea below, then seizes the creatures one by one and throws them ashore still writhing; so Skylla swung my writhing companions up to the rocks, and there at the entrance began devouring them as they shrieked and held out heir hands to me in their extreme of agony. Many pitiful things have met my eyes in my toilings and searchings through the sea-paths, but this was most pitiful of all. When we had left the rocks behind us with Skylla and terrible Kharybdis, we came soon enough to the lovely island of the sun-god."

On one course lay the rocks called Planktai (Planctae), and on the other were two great cliffs, in one of which was Skylla (Scylla), daughter of Krataiis (Crataeis) and Trienos or Phorkos (Phorcus). She had the face and breast of a woman, but from her flanks grew six dog-heads and twelve dog-feet. On the other crag was Kharybdis (Charybdis) . . . Kirke (Circe) had warned Odysseys against taking the course by the Planktai, so he started instead past the cliff of Skylla, placing himself on the stern, armed to the teeth. But Skylla appeared, grabbed six comrades and gulped them down."

  She has a girl's sweet face, and if the tales the poets have passed down are not all false, she was a sweet girl once.

     Many a suitor sought her hand, but she repulsed them all and went to the Sea-Nymphs (

     Galatea ended and the group of Nereides dispersed and swam away across the placid waters of the bay. Scylla turned back; she dared not trust herself far out at sea. Along the thirsty sands she sauntered naked or, when she was tired, made for a little land-locked cove and in its sheltered waves enjoyed a cooling bathe. Suddenly, breaking the surface of the sea [the sea-god] Glaucus appeared . . . He saw the girl, and stopped, his heart transfixed, then spoke to her, spoke anything he thought might stay her flight. But Scylla fled (her terror gave her speed) and reached a cliff-top rising from the shore, a vast cliff by the strait, that towered up to one great peak and with its tree-clad height rose in a curve far out over the sea. The place was safe; she stopped; she could not tell if he were god or monster . . .
     <br/>
     So much he [Glaukos (Glaucus)] said [trying to woe Skylla], and would have said more too, but Scylla fled. 
  Enraged at his repulse, he made in fury for the magic halls of Circe . . .
     <br/>
     [And Circe confessed her love for the sea-god :] ‘. . . I, Circe, pray that I be yours. Spurn her who spurns you; welcome one who wants you. By one act requite us both!’
     <br/>
     But Glaucus answered: ‘Sooner shall green leaves grow in the sea or seaweed on the hills that I shall change my love while Scylla lives.’
     <br/>
     Rage filled the goddess' heart. She had no power nor wish to wound him--for she loved him well--, so turned her anger on the girl he chose. In fury at his scorn, she ground together her ill-famed herbs, her herbs of ghastly juice, and, as she ground them, sang her demon spells . . .
     <br/>
     There was a little bay, bent like a bow, a place of peace, where Scylla loved to laze, her refuge from the rage of sea and sky, when in mid heaven the sun with strongest power shone from his zenith and the shade lay least. Against her coming Circe had defiled this quiet bay with her deforming drugs, and after them had sprinkled essences of noxious roots; then with her witch's lips had muttered thrice nine times a baffling maze of magic incantations. Scylla came and waded in waist-deep, when round her lions she saw foul monstrous barking beasts. At first, not dreaming they were part of her, she fled and thrust in fear the bullying brutes away. But what she feared and fled, she fetched along, and looking for her thighs, her legs, her feet, found gaping jaws instead like Hades' vile hound [Kerberos (Cerberus)]. Poised on a pack of beasts! No legs! Below her midriff dogs, ringed in a raging row! Glaucus her lover, wept and fled the embrace of Circe who had used too cruelly the power of her magic. Scylla stayed there where she was and, when the first chance came to vent her rage and hate on Circe, robbed Ulixes [Odysseus] of his comrades. Later, too, she would have sunk the Trojan galleons, had she not been transformed before they came into a reef whose rocks rise up today, and sailors shun her still and steer away."
