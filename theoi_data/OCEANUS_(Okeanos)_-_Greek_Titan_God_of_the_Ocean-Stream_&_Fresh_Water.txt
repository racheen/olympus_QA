   OCEANUS (Okeanos) - Greek Titan God of the Ocean-Stream &amp; Fresh Water
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Oceanus was the primordial Titan god of the great, earth-encircling River Ocean, font of all of the earth's fresh-water - rivers, wells, springs and rain-clouds. He was also the god who regulated the heavenly bodies which rose from and set into his waters. Oceanus was depicted as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish." name="description"/>

     OKEANOS (Oceanus) was the primordial Titan god of the great, earth-encircling
     <a href="../Kosmos/Okeanos.html">
      River Okeanos
     </a>
     ,  font of all of the earth's fresh-water - rivers, wells, springs and rain-clouds. He was also the god who regulated the heavenly bodies which rose from and set into his waters. 
Okeanos' wife
     <a href="TitanisTethys.html">
      Tethys
     </a>
     "the Nurse"  was probably envisioned distributing his nourishing waters across the earth through subterranean acquifers. Their children were the
     <a href="../Potamos/Potamoi.html">
      Potamoi
     </a>
     , gods of rivers, and the
     <a href="../Nymphe/Okeanides.html">
      Okeanides (Oceanids)
     </a>
     , nymphs of springs and fountains. Unlike his Titan-brothers Okeanos did not participate in the castration of their father
     <a href="../Protogenos/Ouranos.html">
      Ouranos
     </a>
     nor join the war against Zeus and the Olympian gods.
    </p>
    <p>
     Okeanos was probably identical to
     <a href="TitanOphion.html">
      Ophion
     </a>
     , an elder Titan in the Orphic myths who ruled heaven briefly before being wrestled and cast into the Ocean stream by
     <a href="TitanKronos.html">
      Kronos (Cronus)
     </a>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Okeanos was depicted in ancient Greek vase painting as a bull-horned god with the tail of a serpentine fish, a form shared by his River-God sons. His usual attributes were a fish and serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Hellenistic era, Okeanos was reimagined as the god of the then increasingly accessible Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and the old cosmological idea of a great, earth-encircling, fresh-water stream was discarded. In mosaic art he is therefore usually depicted as a sea-god or the sea itself personified, with crab-claw horns, and for attributes, a serpent, oar and school of fish. His wife Tethys, shown seated beside him, had wings on her brow, in her role as the mother of rain-clouds.

     OCE′ANUS (Ôkeanos), the god of the river Oceanus, by which, according to the most ancient notions of the Greeks, the whole earth was surrounded. An account of this river belongs to mythical geography, and we shall here confine ourselves to describing the place which Oceanus holds in the ancient cosmogony. In the Homeric poems he appears as a mighty god, who yields to none save Zeus. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xiv. 245, xx. 7, xxi. 195.) Homer does not mention his parentage, but calls Tethys his wife, by whom he had three daughters, Thetis, Eurynome and Perse. (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xiv. 302, xviii. 398,
     <em>
      Od.
     </em>
     x. 139.) His palace is placed somewhere in the west (
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     xiv. 303, &amp;c.), and there he and Tethys brought up Hera, who was conveyed to them at the time when Zeus was engaged in the struggle with the Titans. Hesiod (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     133, 337, &amp;c., 349, &amp;c.) calls Oceanus a son of Uranus and Gaea, the eldest of the Titans, and the husband of Tethys, by whom he begot 3000 rivers, and as many Oceanides, of whom Hesiod mentions only the eldest. (Comp. Apollod. iii. 8. § 1, 10. § 1.) This poet (
     <em>
      Theog.
     </em>
     282) also speaks of sources of Oceanus. Representations of the god are seen on imperial coins of Tyre and Alexandria.

     She [Tethys] brought forth also a race apart of daughters [Okeanides (Oceanids)], who with lord Apollon and the Rivers have the young in their keeping all over the earth, since this right from Zeus is given them. They are Peitho, Admete, Ianthe and Elektra (Electra), Doris and Prymno and Ourania (Urania) like a goddess, Hippo and Klymene (Clymene), Rhodeia and Kallirhoe (Callirhoe), Zeuxo and Klytia (Clytia), and Idyia and Pasithoe, Plexaura and Galaxaura and lovely Dione, Melobosis and Thoe, and Polydora the shapely, Kerkeis (Cerceis) of the lovely stature, and ox-eyed Plouto (Pluto), Xanthe and Akaste (Acaste), Perseis and Ianeira, Petraie the lovely, and Menestho, and Europa, Metis and Eurynome, Telesto robed in saffron, Khryseis (Chryseis), and Asia, and alluring Kalypso (Calypso), Eudora and Tykhe (Tyche), and Amphiro and Okyroe (Ocyroe), and Styx, who among them all has the greatest eminence.

     </span>
     <br/>
     "[Enter Okeanos (Oceanus) on a winged steed.] [Prometheus is chained to a crag in the Kaukasos (Caucasus) mountains.]
     <br/>
     Okeanos : I have come to the end of a long journey in my passage to you, Prometheus, guiding by my own will, without a bridle, this swift-winged bird. For your fate, you may be sure, I feel compassion. Kinship, I think, constrains me to this; and, apart from blood ties, there is none to whom I should pay greater respect than to you. You shall know this for simple truth and that it is not in me to utter vain and empty words; come, tell me; what aid can I render you? For you shall never say that you have a friend more loyal than Okeanos.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : Ha! What have we here? So then you too have come to stare upon my sufferings? How did you summon courage to quit the stream that bears your name and the rock-roofed caves you yourself have made and come to this land, the mother of iron? Is it that you have come to gaze upon my state and join your grief to my distress? Look upon me here--a spectacle, the friend of Zeus, who helped him to establish his sovereign power, by what anguish I am bent by him!
     <br/>
     Okeanos : I see, Prometheus; and I want to give you the best advice, although you yourself are wily. Learn to know yourself and adapt yourself to new ways; for new also is the ruler among the gods. If you hurl forth words so harsh and of such whetted edge, perhaps Zeus may hear you, though throned far off, high in the heavens, and then your present multitude of sorrows shall seem but childish sport. Oh wretched sufferer! Put away your wrathful mood and try to find release from these miseries. Perhaps this advice may seem to you old and dull; but your plight, Prometheus, is only the wages of too boastful speech. You still have not learned humility, nor do you bend before misfortune, but would rather add even more miseries to those you have. Therefore take me as your teacher and do not add insult to injury, seeing that a harsh monarch now rules who is accountable to no one. So now I will depart and see whether I can release you from these sufferings. And may you hold your peace and be not too blustering of speech. Or, can it be that for all your exceeding wisdom, you do not know that chastisement is inflicted on a wagging tongue?
     <br/>
     Prometheus : I envy you because you have escaped blame for having dared to share with me in my troubles. So now leave me alone and let it not concern you. Do what you want, you cannot persuade him; for he is not easy to persuade. Beware that you do not do yourself harm by the mission you take.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : In truth, you are far better able to admonish others than yourself. It is by fact, not by hearsay, that I judge. So do not hold back one who is eager to go. For I am confident, yes, confident, that Zeus will grant me this favor, to free you from your sufferings.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : But you are not inexperienced, and do not need me to teach you. Save yourself, as you know best; while I exhaust my present lot until the time comes when the mind of Zeus shall abandon its wrath.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : Do you not know then, Prometheus, that words are the physicians of a disordered temper?
     <br/>
     Prometheus : If one softens the soul in season, and does not hasten to reduce its swelling rage by violence.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : What lurking mischief do you see when daring joins to zeal? Teach me this.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : Lost labor and thoughtless simplicity.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : Leave me to be affected by this, since it is most advantageous, when truly wise, to be deemed a fool.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : This fault will be seen to be my own.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : Clearly the manner of your speech orders me back home.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : So that you won't win enmity for yourself by lamenting for me.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : In the eyes of the one who is newly seated on his omnipotent throne?
     <br/>
     Prometheus : Beware lest the time come when his heart is angered with you.
     <br/>
     Okeanos: Your plight, Prometheus, is my instructor.
     <br/>
     Prometheus : Go away, depart, keep your present purpose.
     <br/>
     Okeanos : Your urging meets my eagerness; for my four-footed winged beast fans with his wings the smooth pathway of the air; and truly he will be glad to rest his knees in his stall at home.

Well, don't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names ‘Rhea’ and ‘Kronos’ (Cronus) [derived by Plato from the Greek words ‘flow’ and ‘time’] had the same thought as Herakleitos? Do you think he gave both of them the names of streams merely by chance?

Agemate and bedmate of Okeanos, ancient as the world, nurse of commingled waters, selfborn, loving mother of children, what shall we do? Now Rainy Zeus blazes in arms against me and your children. Even as Asopos (Asopus) found the father Zeus Kronion (Cronion) his destroyer, in the bastard shape of a bird, so Hydaspes has found Bakkhos (Bacchus) the son. Nay, I will bring my water against he lightnings of Zeus, and drown the fiery Sun in my quenching flood, I will put out the Stars of heaven! Kronion shall see me overwhelm Selene (the Moon) with my roaring streams. Under the region of the Bear, I will wash with my waters the ends of the axle and the dry track of the Wain. The heavenly Dolphin, which long ago swam in my deep sea, I will make to swim once more, and cover him with new seas. I will drag down from heaven the fiery Eridanos (Eridanus) whose course is among the stars, and bring him back to a new home in the Celtic land: he shall be water again, and the sky shall be bare of the river of fire. The starry Fishes that swim on high I will pull in to the sea and make them mine again, to swim in water instead of Olympos. Tethys, awake! We will drown the stars in water, that I may see the Bull, who once swam over a waveless sea, tossed on stormier waves in the paths of the waters after the bed of Europa. Selene herself, bullshaped and horned driver of cattle, may be angry to see my horned bullshaped form. I will travel high into the heaven, that I may behold Kepheus (Cepheus) drenched and the Wagggoner in soaking tunic, as Earthshaker [Poseidon] once did when about Korinthos (Corinth) soaking Ares once boldly shouted defiance of battle against stars! I will swallow the shining Goat, the nurse of Zeus, and I will offer infinite water to the Waterman as a suitable gift. Get ready, Tethys, and you, O Thalassa (Sea)! For Zeus has been delivered of a base son in bull shape, to destroy all Rivers and all creatures together, all blameless: the thyrsus wand has slain the Indians, the torch has burnt Hydaspes!’

  Father Zeus turned aside the menace of his angry son, for he massed the clouds and flung out a thunderclap; he stayed the flaming attack of Dionysos, and calmed the anger of boundless Okeanos. Hera also made an infinite noise resound through the air, to restrain the wrath of Dionysos' fiery power. 
  Then old Hydaspes held out a wet hand to merciful Bakkhos, and appealed to the fiery son of Zeus in words that bubbled out of his lips : ‘. . . I am ashamed to appear before my father [Okeanos], because the murmuring stream which I draw is mingled with blood, and I pollute Poseidon with clots of gore; this it was, only this that armed to strive against Dionysos. By your father, protector of guests and suppliants, have mercy on Hydaspes, now hot and boiling with your fire!’"

     "Loudbooming Okeanos (Oceanus), girdled with the circle of the sky, who leads his water earth-encompassing round the turning point which he bathes, was joined in primeval wedlock with Tethys. The water bride-groom begat Klymene (Clymene), fairest of the Neiades (Naiads), whom Tethys nursed on her wet breast, her youngest, a maiden with lovely arms. For her beauty Helios (the Sun) pined . . . The torch of love was stronger than the blaze of his car and the shining of his rays, when over the bend of the reddened Okeanos as he bathed his fiery form in the eastern waters, he beheld the maiden close by the way, while she swam naked and sported in her father's waves . . . Her father united the girl to the heavenly charioteer [Helios]. The lightfoot Horai (Hours) acclaimed Klymene's bridal with Helios Phaesphoros (Lightbringer), the Nymphai Neides (Naiad Nymphs) [Okeanides] danced around; in a watery bridal-bower the fruitful maiden was wedded in a flaming union, and received the hot bridegroom into her cool arms . . . and Okeanos beside his bride Tethys sounded his song with all the fountains of his throat.
     <br/>
     As he [Phaethon son of Helios and Klymene (Clymene)] sprang from the childbed, the daughters of Okeanos cleansed him, Klymene's son, in his grandsire's waters, and wrapt him in swaddlings. The Stars (Asteres) in shining movement leapt into the stream of Okeanos which they knew so well, and surrounded the boy, with Selene Eileithyia (our Lady of Labour), sending forth her sparkling gleams . . .
     <br/>
     Often in the course of the boy's training Okeanos would have a pretty game, lifting Phaethon on his midbelly and letting him drop down; he would throw the boy high in the air, rolling over and over moving in a high path as quick as the wandering wind, and catch him again on his arm; then he would shoot him up again, and the boy would avoid the ready hand of Okeanos, and turn a somersault round and round till he splashed into the dark waters, prophet of his own death. The old man groaned when he saw it, recognizing the divine oracle, and hid all in prudent silence, that he might not tear the happy heart of Klymene the loving mother by foretelling the cruel threads of Phaethon's Fate."

Juno [Hera], in fury when that concubine shone midst the stars, descended to the sea, to Tethys and old Oceanus, whom the gods greatly revere, and to their questioning replied : ‘You ask why I, Regina Deorum (Queen of the Gods), come hither from the mansions of the sky? I am dethroned; another reigns; my words are false unless, when night darkens the world, you see, new-honoured in heaven to injure me, twin constellations at the utmost pole, where earth in last and shortest circle turns. Who now would hesitate to insult Juno [Hera]? . . . She whom I forbade to be a woman [by transforming her into a bear], made a goddess! Thus the guilty pay! So great my sovereignty! . . .

     Okeanos (Oceanus) was equated with Pontos (Pontus, the Sea) by late classical writers. The association occurred after Greek explorers reached the Atlantic and Indian Oceans, to discover a salty, rather than fresh-water, sea.

Instantly torrents cascaded down from near and far and poured whole seas of waters on my head. So far I can relate what I recall, so far remember; but the rest is lost. When sense returned, I found myself in body another self, nor was my mind the same.
