   BELLEROPHON (Bellerophontes) - Hero of Greek Mythology
  </title>
  <meta content="In Greek mythology Bellerophon was one of the most celebrated heroes. He was a son of the god Poseidon and Eurynome, wife of King Glaucus of Corinth. In his youth Bellerophon captured the winged horse Pegasus as it came to drink from the town's fountain.He was later exiled for the murder of a family member and journeyed to the court of King Proetus in Argos for purification. The queen, however, developed a lust for the hero and when he spurned her, she told her husband he had tried to violate her. Proetus then sent him off to King Iobates in Lycia with a closed letter requesting the youth be put to death. Iobates was reluctant to do this himself and so commanded Bellerophon to slay the fire-breathing Chimera which was ravaging the land." name="description"/>

     BELLEROPHONTES (Bellerophon) was one of the most celebrated heroes of myth. He was a son of the god Poseidon and Eurynome, wife of King Glaukos (Glaucus) of Korinthos (Corinth). In his youth Bellerophontes captured the winged horse
     <a href="../Ther/HipposPegasos.html">
      Pegasos
     </a>
     as it came to drink from the town's fountain.
    </p>
    <p>
     He was later exiled for the murder of a family member and journeyed to the court of King Proitos (Proetus) in Argos for purification. The queen, however, developed a lust for the hero and when he spurned her,  she told her husband he had tried to violate her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Proitos then sent him off to King Iobates in Lykia (Lycia) with a closed letter requesting the youth be put to death. Iobates was reluctant to do this himself and so commanded Bellerophontes to slay the fire-breathing
     <a href="../Ther/Khimaira.html">
      Khimaira (Chimera)
     </a>
     which was ravaging the land. He rode into battle against the beast on the back of Pegasos and slew it by driving a lead-tipped spear into its fiery gullet.
    </p>
    <p>
     The king then ordered him to subdue the barbarous Solymoi tribe, and later the Amazones, but again he proved victorious. Finally, Iobates commanded his guards to ambush and kill the youth, but he slew them all. The king was forced to acknowledge that Bellerophontes must be the son of a god and welcomed him into his house as his son-in-law and heir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite all of his successes,  Bellerophontes was still not satisfied  and sought to ascend to heaven on the back of Pegasos. Zeus was angered by his presumption and sent a gadfly to sting the horse, causing it to buck and cast the hero back down to earth. After this he wandered the world alone, despised by both gods and men.
    </p>
    <p>
     The mythological etymology of Bellerophontes name was "Slayer of Belleros" from the Greek
     <em>
      Belleros
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      phonos
     </em>
     . However, it is likely that the name originally meant "Wielder of Missiles" from the Greek words
     <em>
      belos
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      phoreô
     </em>
     .

     BELLE′ROPHON or BELLEROPHONTES (Bellerophôn or Bellerophontês), properly called Hipponous, was a son of the Corinthian king, Glaucus and Eurymede, and a grandson of Sisyphus. (Apollod. i. 9. § 3; Hom.
     <em>
      Il.
     </em>
     vi. 155.) According to Hyginus (
     <em>
      Fab.
     </em>
     157; comp. Pind.
     <em>
      Ol.
     </em>
     xiii. 66), he was a son of Poseidon and Eurymede. He is said to have received the name Bellerophon or Bellerophontes from having slain the noble Corinthian, Bellerus. (Tzetz.
     <em>
      ad Lycoph.
     </em>
     17; Eustath.
     <em>
      Hom.
     </em>
     p. 632.) Others related, that he had slain his own brother, Deliades, Peiren, or Alcimenes. (Apollod. ii. 3. § 1, &amp;c.) In order to be purified from the murder, whichever it may have been, he fled to Proetus, whose wife Anteia fell in love with the young hero; but her offers being rejected by him, she accused him to her husband of having made improper proposals to her, and insisted upon his being put to death. Proetus, unwilling to kill him with his own hands, sent him to his father-in-law, Iobates, king in Lycia, with a sealed letter in which the latter was requested to put the young man to death. Iobates accordingly sent him to kill the monster Chimaera, thinking that he was sure to perish in the contest. Bellerophon mounted the winged horse, Pegasus, and rising up with him into the air, killed the Chimaera from on high with his arrows. Iobates, being thus disappointed, sent Bellerophon out again, first against the Solymi and next against the Amazons. In these contests too he was victorious; and when, on his return to Lycia, he was attacked by the bravest Lycians, whom Iobates had placed in ambush for the purpose, Bellerophon slew them all. Iobates, now seeing that it was hopeless to attempt to kill the hero, showed him the letter he had received from Proetus, gave him his daughter (Philonoë, Anticleia, or Cassandra) for his wife, and made him his successor on the throne. Bellerophon became the father of Isander, Hippolochus, and Laodameia. Here Apollodorus breaks off the story; and Homer, whose account (vi. 155-202) differs in some points from that of Apollodorus, describes the later period of Bellerophon's life only by saying, that he drew upon himself the hatred of the gods, and, consumed by grief, wandered lonely through the Aleian field, avoiding the paths of men. We must here remark with Eustathius, that Homer knows nothing of Bellerophon killing the Chimaera with the help of Pegasus, which must therefore be regarded in all probability as a later embellishment of the story. The manner in which he destroyed the Chimaera is thus described by Tzetzes (
     <em>
      l. c.
     </em>
     ): he fixed lead to the point of his lance, and thrust it into the fire-breathing mouth of the Chimaera, who was accordingly killed by the molten lead. According to others, Bellerophon was assisted by Athena Chalinitis or Hippia. (Paus. ii. 1. § 4; Pind.
     <em>
      l. c.;
     </em>
     Strab. viii. p. 379.) Some traditions stated, that he attempted to rise with Pegasus into heaven, but that Zeus sent a gad-fly, which stung Pegasus so, that he threw off the rider upon the earth, who became lame or blind in consequence. (Pind.
     <em>
      Isth.
     </em>
     vii. 44; Schol.
     <em>
      ad Pind. Ol.
     </em>
     xiii. 130; Horat.
     <em>
      Carm.
     </em>
     iv. 11. 26.) A peculiar story about Bellerophon is related by Plutarch. (
     <em>
      De Virt. Mul.
     </em>
     p. 247, &amp;c.) Bellerophon was worshipped as a hero at Corinth, and had a sanctuary near the town in the cypress grove, Craneion. (Paus. ii. 2. § 4.) Scenes of the story of Bellerophon were frequently represented in ancient works of art. His contest with the Chimaera was seen on the throne of Amyclae (ii. 18. § 7), and in the vestibule of the Delphic temple. (Eurip.
     <em>
      Ion,
     </em>
     203.) On coins, gems, and vases he is often seen fighting against the Chimaera, taking leave of Proetus, taming Pegasus or giving him to drink, or falling from him. But, until the recent discoveries in Lycia by Mr. Fellows, no representation of Bellerophon in any important work of art was known; in Lycian sculptures, however, he is seen riding on Pegasus and conquering the Chimaera.

      Homer, Iliad 6. 144 - 221 ff (trans. Lattimore) (Greek epic C8th B.C.) :
     </span>
     <br/>
     "[During a battle of the Trojan War the Greek hero Diomedes asks after the ancestory of Glaukos (Glaucus), a Lykian ally of the Trojans :] The shining son [Glaukos] of Hippolokhos (Hippolochus) answered : ‘High-hearted [Diomedes] son of Tydeus, why ask of my generation? . . . If you wish to learn all this and be certain of my genealogy : there are plenty of men who know it. There is a city Ephyre [Korinthos (Corinth)], in the corner of horse-pasturing Argos; there lived Sisyphos, Aiolos' (Aeolus') son, and he had a son named Glaukos (Glaucus), and Glaukos in turn sired Bellerophontes the blameless. To Bellerophontes the gods granted beauty and desirable manhood; but Proitos (Proetus) in anger devised evil things against him, and drove him out of his own domain, since he was far greater, from the Argive country Zeus had broken to the sway of his sceptre. Beautiful Anteia the wife of Proitos was striken with passion to lie in love with him, and yet she could not beguile valiant Bellerophones, whose will was virtuous. So she went to Proitos the king and uttered her falsehood : "Would you be killed, o Proitos? Then murder Bellerophontes who tried to lie with me in love, though I was unwilling." So she spoke, and anger took hold of the king at her story. He shrank from killing him, since his heart was awed by such action, but sent him away to Lykia (Lycia), and handed him murderous symbols, which he inscribed in a folding tablet, enough to destroy life, and told him to show it to his wife's father, that he might perish.
     <br/>
     ‘Bellerophontes went to Lykia in the blameless convoy of the gods; when he came to the running stream of Xanthos (Xanthus), and Lykia, the lord of wide Lykia tendered him full-hearted honour. Nine days he entertained him with sacrifice of nine oxen, but afterwards when the rose fingers of the tenth dawn showed, then he began to question him, and asked to be show the symbols, whatever he might be carrying from his son-in-law, Proitos. Then after he had been given his son-in-law's wicked symbols first he sent him away with orders to kill the Khimaira (Chimera) none might approach; a thing of immortal make, not human, lion-fronted and snake behind, a goat in the middle, and snorting out the breath of the terrible flame of bright fire. He killed the Khimaira, obeying the portents of the immortals.
     <br/>
     ‘Next after this he fought against the glorious Solymoi (Solymi), and this he thought was the strongest battle with men that he entered; but third he slaughtered the Amazones (Amazons), who fight men in battle. Now as he came back the king spun another entangling treachery; for choosing the bravest men in wide Lykia he laid a trap, but these men never came home thereafter since all of them were killed by blameless Bellerophontes. Then when the king knew him for the powerful stock of the god, he detained him there, and offered him the hand of his daughter, and gave him half of all the kingly privilege. Thereto the men of Lykia cut out a piece of land, surpassing all others, fine ploughland and orchard for him to administer.
     <br/>
     ‘His bride bore three children to valiant Bellerophontes, Isandros (Isander) and Hippolokhos (Hippolochus) and Laodameia. Laodameia lay in love beside Zeus of the counsels and bore him godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helmet. But after Bellerophontes was hated by all the immortals, he wandered alone about the plain of Aleios (Aleus), eating his heart out, skulking aside from the trodden track of humanity. As for Isandros his son, Ares the insatiate of fighting killed him in close battle against the glorious Solymoi, while Artemis of the golden reins killed the daughter in anger. But Hippolokhos begot me [Glaukos], and I claim he is my father; he sent me to Troy, and urged upon me repeated injunctions, to be always among the bravest, and hold my head above others, not shaming the generation of my fathers, who were the greatest men in Ephyre and again in wide Lykia. Such is my generation and the blood I claim to be born from.’
     <br/>
     He spoke, and Diomedes of the great war cry was gladdened . . . and in winning words of friendliness he spoke to the shepherd of the people : ‘See now, you are my guest friend from far in the time of our fathers. Brilliant Oineus (Oeneus) [king of Kalydon (Calydon), grandfather of Diomedes,] once was host to Bellerophontes the blameless, in his halls, and twenty days he detained him, and these two gave to each other fine gifts in token of friendship. Oineus gave his guest a war belt bright with the red dye, Bellerophontes a golden and double-handled drinking-cup, a thing I left behind in my house when I came on my journey.’"

     "For when there came Glaukos (Glaucus) from Lykia (Lycia) [to join the Trojan War], the Danaans' hearts were chill with deadly fear, hearing him boast that in Peirene's city [Korinthos (Corinth)] his own forebear once held the soverign power, and the great heritage of kingly palace and wide patrimony : that grandsire  once strove in vain beside Peirene's spring, and suffered much, seeking to yoke the snake-haired Gorgo's (Gorgon's) offspring, Pegasos (Pegasus). Till Pallas [Athena], goddess maid, brought him the bridle and golden headband, and behold a dream was truth. ‘Sleep not, Aiolid king,’ said she, ‘but take this charm of steeds, and offer the Horse-Tamer, your sire, a snow-white bull, and show to him this bridle.’
     <br/>
     Such words, as he lay slumbering in the dark, it seemed the maiden of the shadowy aegis spoke unto him, and he leapt to his feet and seized the magic bit, that lay beside him on the ground; and went with joy to find the prophet of his country's people the son of Koiranos (Coeranus). And he made known to him the whole issue of this strange matter--how that he had lain the whole night through upon the goddess' altar, as the seer had foretold him, and how the child of Zeus whose sword is lightning, in her own hands brought him the golden charm that tames the savage spirit. And the prophet bade him obey at once the magic vision, and to Poseidon, the earth-holder, to sacrifice the strong-limbed bull. Then too that he should build an altar with all speed to Athene, queen of steeds. Yet the gods' power can lightly bring to pass such things as will deny both the sworn word and all the hopes of men. Thus with all zeal mighty Bellerophontes seized the winged steed, setting between his jaws the soothing charm, and mounting him, in his bronze panoply played him in sport, to try his pace. And once, with him, he smote the Amazones (Amazons), from the chill bosom of the lonely air, that archered host of women-kind; and felled Khimaira (Chimera) breathing fire, and slew the Solymoi. His fate--'twere best unspoken. But Pegasos dwells in the ancient stalls of Zeus upon Olympos."

     </span>
     <br/>
     "Bellerophontes, the son of Sisyphos' son Glaukos (Glaucus), involuntarily killed his brother, whose name was, according to various sources, Deliades or Peiren or Alkimenes (Alcimenes). So Bellerophontes came to Proitos (Proetus) for purification. Stheneboia (Stheneboea) fell in love with him and sent him written invitations to a romantic tryst. When he spurned her, she told Proitos that Bellerophontes had sent her messages of the grossest nature.
     <br/>
     Proitos believed what she told him, and gave Bellerophontes a letter to deliver to Iobates [king of Lykia (Lycia)], in which it was written that he was to murder Bellerophontes. When Iobates read it, he ordered Bellerophontes to slay the Khimaira (Chimera), assuming that he would instead by destroyed himself by the beast, since not even a quantity of men could subdue it with ease, let alone one. For it was a single being that had the force of three beasts, the front part of a lion, the tail of a dragon, and the third (middle) head was that of a goat, through which it breathed out fire. It despoiled the countryside and ravaged the herds. It was allegedly reared by Amisodaros, as Homer also states, and according to Hesiod its parents were Typhon and Ekhidna (Echidna). Bellerophontes mounted Pegasos (Pegasus), his winged horse born of Medousa (Medusa) and Poseidon, and flying high into the air brought down the Khimaira with his bow and arrows.
     <br/>
     After this challenge, Iobates ordered him to battle the Solymoi (Solymi), and when that was done, to take on the Amazones. When he had slain these, Iobates selected from the Lykians  those most famous for their vigor, and instructed them to murder Bellerophontes in ambush; but when Bellerophontes had slain every one of them as well, Iobates, awestruck by his strength, showed him Proitos' letter and said he would be honoured if Bellerophontes stayed on with him. He gave him his daughter Philonoe, and, when he died, he left him his kingdom."

     "[In the town of Korinthos (Corinth)] is the temple of Athena Chalinitis (Bridler). For Athena, they say, was the divinity who gave most help to Bellerophontes, and she delivered to him Pegasos (Pegasus), having herself broken in and bridled him. The image of her is of wood, but face, hands and feet are of white marble. That Bellerophontes was not an absolute king, but was subject to Proitos (Proetus) and the Argives is the belief of myself and of all who have read carefully the Homeric poems. When Bellerophontes migrated to Lykia (Lycia) it is clear that the Korinthians none the less were subject to the despots at Argos or Mykenai (Mycenae). By themselves they provided no leader for the campaign against Troy, but shared in the expedition as part of the forces, Mykenaian and other, led by Agamemnon.
     <br/>
     Sisyphos had other sons besides Glaukos, the father of Bellerophontes a second was Ornytion, and besides him there were Thersandros (Thersander) and Almos."

Now Proitos was unwilling to slay his guest, and so instead he sent him to Lykia (Lycia), having a written message to Iobates the king, who was his father-in-law. Iobates received the letter and discovered that in it was written that he should slay Bellerophontes with all speed; but, being unwilling to put him to death, he commanded him instead to go join combat with the fire-breathing Khimaira (Chimera).“

  At the time Bellerophon came to visit Proetus, son of Abas and king of the Argives, Antia, the king's wife, smitten with love for the guest, begged to visit him, promising him her husband's kingdom. When she couldn't obtain this request, out of fear that he would accuse her to the king, she anticipated him by telling Proetus that he had offered violence to her. Proetus, who had been fond of Bellerophon, ws reluctant to inflict punishment himself, but knowing that he had the horse Pegasus, sent him to the father of Antia (some call her Sthenoboea), for him to defend his daughter's chastity and send the youth against the Chimera, which at that time was laying waste with flames the country of the Lycians. 
  Bellerophon was victor, and escaped, but after the creation of the spring, as he was attempting to fly to heaven, and had almost reached it, he became terrified looking down at the earth, and fell off and was killed. But the horse is said to have flown up and to have been put among the constellations by Jove [Zeus].
